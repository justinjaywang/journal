It was nice and relaxing.</p><p>I flew back on Christmas Eve, and read <em>The Shape of Design</em> by Frank Chimero. Jen and Mom picked me up when I arrived and then we ate dumplings for dinner. On Christmas Day, we watched the Warriors–Cavs game while preparing food for dinner later at the Wanninger’s.</p><p>After lunch the next day, Jen and I went shopping and Brendan visited. We had planned to play basketball, but it was too windy so we hung out and watched TV instead. I made a dinner of tomato eggs, string beans with minced pork, and pan-fried tofu.</p><p>On Sunday, I played tennis with Josh at the high school and then made lunch. Dinner that night at Uncle Ray’s. The next few days, I mostly hung out at home, cooking meals for myself and Mom, going on walks, and working on projects.</p><p><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/4291520/journal-images/la-palms.jpg" alt="Palm trees in LA."></p><p>On New Year’s Day, I drove up to LA to visit Byron. We spent the day exploring the city with Amy and Vanessa. Highlights included the Griffith Observatory, and dinner and bowling in Koreatown.</p><p>I spent the remainder of the weekend relaxing (such as re-watching <em>Garden State</em>) before working remotely the last week I was home. On my last night, I got dinner with Randy, Josh, Joyce, and Brian at Souplantation (Randy and Brian had just got back from their Asia trip). We hung out at Youmi’s afterwards.</p><hr><p>Zach Braff paraphrases his character from <em>Garden State</em>:</p><blockquote><p>I’m 26 years old, and I’ve spent my whole life waiting for something else to start. Now I realize that this is all there is, and I’m going to try to live my life like that.</p></blockquote></section><footer class="post-footer container container--narrow"><ul class="post-tag-list"><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/books/">books</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/daily/">daily</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/food/">food</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/los-angeles/">los angeles</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/movies/">movies</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/oc/">oc</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/reflection/">reflection</a></li></ul></footer></article><script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.0.3/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/js/all.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">!function(e,a,t,n,c,o,s){e.GoogleAnalyticsObject=c,e[c]=e[c]||function(){(e[c].q=e[c].q||[]).push(arguments)},e[c].l=1*new Date,o=a.createElement(t),s=a.getElementsByTagName(t)[0],o.async=1,o.src=n,s.parentNode.insertBefore(o,s)}(window,document,"script","//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js","ga"),ga("create","UA-15132368-5","auto"),ga("send","pageview");</script></body></html>
