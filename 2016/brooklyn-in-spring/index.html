I’ve been focusing a lot of my energy on work, and it’s paying off—I feel like I’m starting to find my stride.</p><p>I’m still mostly cooking at home (asparagus; wood ear mushrooms; potato dumplings; roasted cauliflower; sweet potato; jicama, cucumber, tomato, and cilantro salad; stir-fried vegetables with doubanjiang and chili oil), but will occasionally eat out with friends on the weekend (notably: spicy pickles and ramen at <a href="http://barchuko.com/bar-chuko-menu/" target="_blank" rel="external">Chuko Ramen</a>; veggie dumplings and Mapo tofu at <a href="http://www.themarket372.info/menu/" target="_blank" rel="external">The Market</a>).</p><p>I try to bring lunch every day, too, but I save it for the next day when the guys do a joint food order. Of the places we go, <a href="http://www.courtstreetgrocers.com/menu-csg/" target="_blank" rel="external">Court Street Grocers</a> has been my favorite, by far. Their “Uncle Chucky” sandwich—roasted cauliflower, pumpkin seed romesco, pickled fennel, red onion, and arugula on a seeded roll—is the best non-Asian food I’ve had in a long while, and probably one of the best sandwiches I’ve ever had. <a href="http://www.redstarbk.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Red Star Sandwich Shop</a> is interesting too, more so for their story (a menu “inspired by the cultural and culinary experience of Asian-Americans”) than their food (though their fried tofu sandwich with gochujang, daikon and dill pickles is pretty solid).</p><p>On Saturdays, I usually play ball with the crew at Classon Playground. The weather’s been nice for that as of late. I look forward to it every week, and am usually dead (in a good way) for the rest of the afternoon, evening, and into Sunday. I’ve been staying up to watch the NBA Playoffs when I can, too, though now I get nervous watching Warriors games. I have to keep reminding myself not to get too invested.</p><p>For music, I’ve been listening to some old favorites—Mates of State, the Wannadies, and Julian Nation—as well as new ones—Frankie Cosmos. I also went to a couple concerts, Yuck and Frankie Cosmos, both in Williamsburg.</p><p>Lastly, a couple family and friend visits: I played tour guide for the weekend when Dad, Arni, and Jonathan came back in mid-April. Then towards the end of April, Brian moved to New York and stayed at my place for a few nights.</p><hr><p>I’ve been inspired lately by Michael Bierut’s monograph <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Graphic-Design-Things-Explain-Better/dp/0062413902" target="_blank" rel="external"><em>How to</em></a>, Roy Choi’s memoir <a href="https://www.amazon.com/L-Son-Life-City/dp/0062202634" target="_blank" rel="external"><em>L.A. Son</em></a>, <em>Brain Pickings</em> articles on <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/12/01/van-gogh-purpose-letter/" target="_blank" rel="external">Van Gogh</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chef%27s_Table" target="_blank" rel="external"><em>Chef’s Table</em></a>, and even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedians_in_Cars_Getting_Coffee" target="_blank" rel="external"><em>Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee</em></a>. The common threads that made all these people great: hard work for a long period of time, perseverance, and dedication to your craft.</p></section><footer class="post-footer container container--narrow"><ul class="post-tag-list"><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/cooking/">cooking</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/daily/">daily</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/family/">family</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/food/">food</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/music/">music</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/new-york/">new york</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/reflection/">reflection</a></li></ul></footer></article><script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.0.3/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/js/all.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">!function(e,a,t,n,c,o,s){e.GoogleAnalyticsObject=c,e[c]=e[c]||function(){(e[c].q=e[c].q||[]).push(arguments)},e[c].l=1*new Date,o=a.createElement(t),s=a.getElementsByTagName(t)[0],o.async=1,o.src=n,s.parentNode.insertBefore(o,s)}(window,document,"script","//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js","ga"),ga("create","UA-15132368-5","auto"),ga("send","pageview");</script></body></html>
