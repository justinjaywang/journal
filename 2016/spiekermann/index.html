It’s been getting colder, though. This morning, the temperature is down to single digits.</p><p>Last weekend, I read <em>Hello, I am Erik</em>, an Erik Spiekermann retrospective.</p><p>My biggest takeaway was that, more than anything, he was a gifted communicator (“You are what you say and how you say it”). Affecting that voice with which you communicate visually is what motivated his work.</p><blockquote><p>I might say that the weather doesn’t interest me. However, it still influences my mood. It’s the same with typography; all cultural expressions influence us. Take buildings, for example: the way they look, how they work. Even if we’re ignorant about architecture, buildings still influence us a lot. The same goes for typography – it influences all of us.</p></blockquote><p>Skylar lent me the book, and he’s been giving me more each week. Along with the office book collection and the nearby Brooklyn Public Library, I feel like I have a wealth of design material to read and learn from, which is a nice feeling to have.</p><p>Other random things:</p><ul><li>With the cold weather, I’ll just be walking and out of nowhere my nose starts to run, full-on dripping down to my mouth. I’d never really experienced that before. Kind of interesting.</li><li>I live right across from a church, and its bells ring the number of hours on the hour (with an additional soft ring at the half hour). I like that. And at noon and 6pm, they play a tune. Reminds me of the Campanile back in school.</li><li>I started making bread again: yeast breads (mostly sandwich rolls in baguette form) and flatbreads. I’ve also been experimenting with cold dishes, like julienned red bell pepper in olive oil, vinegar, and garlic.</li></ul></section><footer class="post-footer container container--narrow"><ul class="post-tag-list"><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/books/">books</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/cooking/">cooking</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/daily/">daily</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/new-york/">new york</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/reflection/">reflection</a></li></ul></footer></article><script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.0.3/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/js/all.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">!function(e,a,t,n,c,o,s){e.GoogleAnalyticsObject=c,e[c]=e[c]||function(){(e[c].q=e[c].q||[]).push(arguments)},e[c].l=1*new Date,o=a.createElement(t),s=a.getElementsByTagName(t)[0],o.async=1,o.src=n,s.parentNode.insertBefore(o,s)}(window,document,"script","//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js","ga"),ga("create","UA-15132368-5","auto"),ga("send","pageview");</script></body></html>
