It’s sad, for sure, but change happens. Hopefully, I won’t lose her as a friend. She’s still my best.</p><p>Things are have changed at my apartment, too. Andrew’s girlfriend Didi moved in. On top of that, we decided to get a cable plan and Andrew bought new TV over the break. In the end, it’s worked out that I’m actually going to be paying less in total rent and utilities than I was previously.</p><p>Finally, I’ve purchased the iPad Air. In fact I’m writing this post on the new device. I’ve been contemplating getting an iPad for several months, and I finally just went for it. I walked to the Apple Store at Bay Street earlier this evening and bought it. I felt like if I was going to get it eventually, I might as well get it sooner rather than later.</p><p>Besides using it for reading (blogs, news, digital books), I plan to use the iPad largely to take notes. I’ve already begun to practice writing on it with the <a href="http://www.goodnotesapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">GoodNotes</a> app. Eventually, I want to get comfortable enough writing on it that it can replace almost all pen and paper in my life. For me, in this way, the iPad is a truly inspirational product—a tool that is powerful, useful, and simplifies our lives. Hopefully, by using it, some of that inspiration will rub off on me.</p></section><footer class="post-footer container container--narrow"><ul class="post-tag-list"><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/daily/">daily</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/reflection/">reflection</a></li></ul></footer></article><article class="post" data-post-id="cic6dpm4j00996q0huvvn0jmx"><header class="post-header container container--narrow"><a href="/2014/end-of-break/"><time class="post-date" datetime="2014-01-07T08:00:00.000Z">Tue, 7 Jan 2014</time><h1 class="post-title">End of break</h1></a></header><section class="post-content container container--narrow"><p><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/4291520/journal-images/grapevine-2.jpg" alt="Driving thought the Grapevine back up to the Bay."></p><p>I had to work the last few days I was home, unfortunately.

I cooked the two filets two ways, one pan-fried and one roasted with oranges.</p><p>I’ve also been inspired to play guitar in earnest once again. I had a few jam sessions in my room this week. What motivated me? Well, I’ve been listening to the band <a href="http://haimtheband.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">HAIM</a> for the past few weeks. The first time I heard them, I was struck at how different their sound was than everything else that’s out there. The more I listened the more interested I became, in their music and in their story. They are three sisters from L.A. who grew up on music. Their talent, especially that of guitarist Danielle, really impressed me. Sometimes I forget how much I used to love music. And I don’t want to lose that part of my life.</p><p>Yesterday, I went with Jennifer and Brendan to the <a href="http://www.museumca.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">Oakland Museum of California</a>. I learned a lot about the history of California, and much reflection and inspiration came out of the trip. For one, it got me thinking about how future generations will remember us, and how the work I do fits into that context. After all, I want to be remembered and have a hand in changing the course of history for the better. My mind was swimming, and I remained pensive for the rest of the evening. OMCA is on my short list of best museums I’ve visited, even though we only got to see one branch of the museum! There are two others we didn’t get to see, so I’ll definitely want to make another visit.</p><p>Tonight, I had dinner with Nina and Meghana in Berkeley, for the occasion that Meghana’s moving away (to Dubai!). We played it by ear and walked to north side on my recommendation and ended up at <a href="http://www.gregoirerestaurant.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Grégoire</a>. I’m glad we did. It was terrific. Imagine, I had lived right around the corner from the restaurant for three years and had been there only once! I ordered cassoulet with duck confit, salted Iberian pork belly, and sausage. I tend not to eat out as much any more because it saves money and I love to cook, but once in a while is enjoyable. It keeps me inspired culinarily.</p><p>Inspiration, be it music, food, or otherwise, drives me to do what I do. At times it can seem difficult to find, but it’s out there. Just takes a little practice.</p></section><footer class="post-footer container container--narrow"><ul class="post-tag-list"><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/daily/">daily</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/food/">food</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/music/">music</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/reflection/">reflection</a></li></ul></footer></article><article class="post" data-post-id="cic6dpm4z009z6q0hja072236"><header class="post-header container container--narrow"><a href="/2013/post-thanksgiving/"><time class="post-date" datetime="2013-12-06T08:00:00.000Z">Fri, 6 Dec 2013</time><h1 class="post-title">Post-Thanksgiving</h1></a></header><section class="post-content container container--narrow"><p>I walked to Berkeley Bowl to get groceries earlier this week.
