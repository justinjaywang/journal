It didn’t occur to me until I got there just how many websites were blocked. I felt helpless, being without a lot of the services I normally use—Google (maps, inbox, search), Dropbox, Twitter, Facebook. Now, though, I can much better appreciate the value these services provide on a daily basis.</p><p><strong>Manners</strong> in Chengdu are, well, different than they are in America. It was pretty noticeable. People there don’t cover their mouths when they cough. And seriously, they hock loogies like no other—everywhere you turn, there’s someone coughing loudly and spitting out phlegm onto the ground, in one fluid sequence.</p><p>In general, I found Chinese people to be very pushy also. If you’re waiting in line, for instance, they’re not afraid to just step in front of you. It’s a me-first mentality. They drive the same way, too.</p><p>Even once I got to Taiwan, I could tell Chinese from Taiwanese just by subtle differences in their manners.</p><p><strong>Seeing</strong> design artifacts from the Jinsha Ruins, of a culture that flourished over 3000 years ago, was pretty remarkable. Art doesn’t get better, maybe. Only the context changes.</p><p>Visiting Du Fu’s Thatched Cottage was interesting, too. I read about some of China’s past artists and poets, and it made me wonder if it was easier to live life as an artist back then than it is now.</p><p><strong>Nothing can compare</strong> to the <a href="https://youtu.be/OQSNhk5ICTI" target="_blank" rel="external">experience</a> of being amidst nature on such a grand scale, such as at Jiuzhaigou. Truly magical. Especially the waterfalls. But it was hard to be fully immersed when there were thousands of Chinese tourists there also, bustling around and being loud. To be deeply engaged in an activity, you really need time and space.</p><p>On one hand, it’s nice that the park is accessible to visitors—after all, I got to see it. But opening up Jiazhaigou, like any nature reserve, just means its eventual destruction, and that makes me sad. Roads and walkways are built. Buses and pollution are brought in. And inevitably, people will leave their trash (and even throw coins into the lakes).</p><p><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/4291520/journal-images/chengdu-trash.jpg" alt="This makes me sad."></p><p><strong>It’s important</strong> to enjoy who you work with (this seems to be a common theme during my travels), and might be the key for me to be happy in a career. During the Mount Qingcheng retreat, Randy and I got to know some of Robert’s co-workers—it helped that they were around our age—and it was definitely the most fun leg of the entire trip.</p><p>One girl in particular was really energetic, upbeat, and liked to joke around, and I got along especially well with her. Hanging out was natural, like we were already friends. I think someone like that would be a good fit for me, to complement my more reserved personality.</p><p><strong>Getting outside</strong> and hiking at Mount Qingcheng was a lot of fun. It felt wonderful to stretch my legs and get my heart rate up, and put me in a good mood the rest of the day. I think I was craving physical activity from being in the city all week. The outdoors and being active are still priorities for me, I realized.</p><p><strong>I got to see</strong> the diversity of Chinese people firsthand. It’s easy to underestimate just how huge the country is, both in size and population. On the Jiuzhaigou tour alone, we met people from a bunch of different provinces—Guangdong, Jiangsu, Beijing. And just walking around, I saw people from a lot of different ethnic groups, too. Growing up in America, you tend to see only certain types of Asians, which are really just a small subset of the total population.</p><p><strong>The food</strong> lived up to the hype. True to form, much of it was numbing and spicy. But it was all so good, and truly unique and special. Some dishes that left an impression on me:</p><ul><li>pao cai—sweet, sour, salty, spicy, with just the right amount of crunch</li><li>braised daikon</li><li>pig’s brain—I had it during spicy hot pot, and it was delicious; very tender</li><li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuqi_feipian" target="_blank" rel="external">fuqi feipian</a></li><li>mei cai kou rou</li><li>wood ear with pepperoncini</li><li>bamboo with ground pork</li><li>steamed bun with a spicy beef meatball filling</li><li>pork strips and red pepper in chili oil</li><li>sliced pork with marinated in fermented beans, chili oil</li><li>sausage in doubanjiang</li><li>red-cooked beef noodle soup</li><li>smoked fish</li><li>red-cooked gluten with celery strips, shiitake, and chili pepper</li><li>pan-fried bun with taro filling</li><li>brined bamboo</li><li>shoestring potatoes and green bell peppers</li><li>wood ear with sliced cucumber (a lot of dishes had wood ear)</li><li>cabbage—a variety with a softer crunch and sweeter taste</li><li>green beans—a more tender variety</li><li>clay pot cauliflower</li><li>lotus root and other liang ban in sesame chili oil</li><li>dandan noodles—preserved vegetables, minced pork, chili oil, scallions, peanuts</li></ul><p><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/4291520/journal-images/chengdu-food-1.jpg" alt="Dinner the first night: cucumber, water-cooked innards, braised daikon, and something else."><br><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/4291520/journal-images/chengdu-food-2.jpg" alt="Lunch with Randy&#39;s relatives.

We ate meals, played sports, and sang karaoke together. I saw where they lived and where they worked. And I saw their favorite hangout spots. As a result, I feel I have a much better sense of the local culture than I would have otherwise. Plus, now I have friends in the Philippines, which is pretty cool.</li><li>Being away from the social world of back home was a breath of fresh air. I saw how liberating it can be to not care what anyone thinks. There was no reason to be self-conscious or shy, especially since everyone was so warm, flattering, and engaging—they were so excited when they first met me. Just be you, and you’ll have fun.</li><li>Seeing the infrastructure there and the way certain things operate gives me more of an appreciation for things that I’ve probably taken for granted, growing up where I have. They’re simple things, like: the ability to walk around a city and feel safe, clean air, people that actually try to help you if you ask a question, and service workers that give any shit. Just to name a few.</li><li>Don’t take parents for granted. While I still can, I should get to know Dad as much as possible (especially times when we’re on the same continent). During this trip, I came a little closer to understanding some of his motivations. We’re alike in a lot of ways; learning about him is partly learning about myself also.</li><li>I’m fortunate for what I have. Not only did I have the means to travel to a foreign country—which not a lot of people in the world can claim—but I had the time away from work to do so via the freedom to quit my job and be selective with my career. I know I’m spoiled in many ways. The best I can do, then, is try to be happy and show appreciation to those who have worked hard to put me in this situation.</li></ol></section><footer class="post-footer container container--narrow"><ul class="post-tag-list"><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/philippines/">philippines</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/reflection/">reflection</a></li></ul></footer></article><article class="post" data-post-id="cii1nigq5003qc80h6d50w0ib"><header class="post-header container container--narrow"><a href="/2015/philippines/"><time class="post-date" datetime="2015-01-28T18:44:42.000Z">Wed, 28 Jan 2015</time><h1 class="post-title">Philippines</h1></a></header><section class="post-content container container--narrow"><p>The journey to the Philippines took over a full day, and involved stops in Taipei and Manila, China Airlines seafood meals, a bag of homemade trail mix, listening to music, naps, and getting moved to a later flight to Cebu—luckily, I met someone nice enough to let me use her phone to notify Dad.</p><p><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/4291520/journal-images/philippines-1.jpg" alt="Layover in Taipei&#39;s Taoyuan Airport."></p><p><strong>Thursday</strong>—First night in the Philippines.

I played volleyball again in the afternoon. I then treated to dinner the people who took care of me during Sinulog—Derek, Lance, Honey, Xyza, Asha, Angel, Nel, Bless, and Linda.</p><p><strong>Saturday</strong>—Island hopping with Dad, some of his friends, and some company people. The day was spent riding on a jeepney to and from the harbor, boating from island to island (three total, I think), swimming with fish, and braving the cold weather. We ate lunch on the boat, too: rice, lumpia, marinated pork belly, kinilaw, shrimp, yams, and dried calamari.</p><p><strong>Sunday</strong>—Lunch at a dim sum restaurant.
