It started when I was in San Jose and would go to the library to browse books for inspiration. Now I can’t get enough.</p><p>A couple weeks ago, I read the comprehensive <em>Meggs’ History of Graphic Design</em>. I never got a formal design education, so I wanted to get a solid foundation and put things in perspective historically. It was interesting to see which designs have stood the test of time and which designs look dated, in a bad way.</p><p>I also checked out a couple of information design books from the public library, <em>Envisioning Information</em> and <em>Beautiful Evidence</em> by Edward R. Tufte. He’s a big proponent of content. If the numbers are boring, then you’ve got the wrong numbers. And clutter is a failure of design, not an attribute of information; but, visual problems shouldn’t be fixed by sacrificing the resolution of the content.</p><p>One chapter from <em>Beautiful Evidence</em> really got to me in particular. It talked about the inherent problems of PowerPoint presentations—good for the confidence of bad presenters (who either don’t know what to say, or worse, don’t really have anything of substance to say), but horrible as a means of communicating something to an audience.</p><p>It’s just that people see, think, and read all the time at intensities greater than watching bulleted list items appear one by one on slide sequences. No wonder I never learned anything from listening to those crappy, templated PowerPoints that teachers and students presented in school. I only ever learned by (1) reading the textbook or (2) practicing or doing.</p><p>The issue is that PowerPoint presentations are used as a substitute for real thought. Smatterings of somewhat related words and phrases are certainly easier than writing full sentences.</p><p>We’ve gotten to a place as a society where we no longer want to think. We just want to mindlessly consume. You see it on the Internet, in the form of short, 140-character bursts of opinion and endless click-bait articles. Everything is dumbed down for us. Time is rarely left for deep thought, which is required for meaningful communication.</p><hr><p>When not reading, I’ve been working on building my personal brand—I designed and coded up my homepage and portfolio, and created themes for documents and presentations. I’ve just begun to reach out to people who’ve contacted me in the past about freelance work that I had to turn down while I was working on other projects.</p><p>For exercise, I’ve been going on walks (and sometimes uphill sprints) along the trails behind El Conejo Park and working on my jump shot in the side yard.</p><p>For food, I’ve been mostly cooking, still—dishes like braised gluten and shiitake, pork belly, slow-roasted chicken, carrot and potato fries, omelettes, and Asian greens from the farmer’s market. I also got a burger (not that good) at dinner with Brian, Randy, and Tariq for Brian’s birthday. Jen was in town this past weekend. She, Mom, and I went out to lunch with Tiffany and her mom at Hsi Lai Temple.</p><p>For entertainment, I’ve been watching the NBA playoffs with Mom. I get so emotionally invested in the games, but I’m trying not to. I take Warriors losses pretty hard, in part because I feel like I’ve grown up with this team. They’re down 2–1 right now in the finals. We’ll see how they respond.</p></section><footer class="post-footer container container--narrow"><ul class="post-tag-list"><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/books/">books</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/daily/">daily</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/food/">food</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/oc/">oc</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/reflection/">reflection</a></li></ul></footer></article><article class="post" data-post-id="cim5n29d00036lm9i7xsbim64"><header class="post-header container container--narrow"><a href="/2015/new-outlook/"><time class="post-date" datetime="2015-06-10T04:06:10.000Z">Wed, 10 Jun 2015</time><h1 class="post-title">New outlook</h1></a></header><section class="post-content container container--narrow"><p>Ten months ago, I reconnected with an old friend from school; I’d always had a crush on her but she always seemed to have a boyfriend. Things eventually ended between us, but the experience changed me. It changed my outlook on life. It made me see that, well, good things really can happen. I never thought they could happen to me, until they did. Sounds cheesy, but it’s true.</p><p>At that time, I kept coming back to this thought of “Why not me?” Since then, I’ve made some bold decisions.

My new plan now is to skip the “get more experience” step and just start freelancing—it was my eventual goal, so I might as well start making mistakes and learning from them, sooner rather than later. Anything I need to learn I can learn as I go, I feel.

My mindset was: <em>work hard, get through school, find a job, and you’ll be happy</em>. As long as I earned a stable income, a job was just a job.</p><p>As it turns out, that was a very narrow outlook. Happiness, after all, lies in your day-to-day experience. How you’re spending time on a routine workday matters just as much as when you’re on vacation. My mindset now is: <em>find a job you love</em>. This means doing work that’s meaningful and rewarding, and with people I like being around.</p><p>I have a lot of skills and interests. But I realize that I can’t pursue everything I’m interested in—there’s just not enough time. The way our society is set up, it’s optimal to choose one profession, and learn to do it well.</p><p>Choosing the right path is hard. Only a select few get it right on their first try. For most people, it takes considerable exploration to find your purpose.</p><p>For me, when I look at the big picture, what is it that really separates me from other people? It’s my creative ability. Always has been, ever since I was little. I’d be doing a disservice to myself by working at a place where I’m not able to fully exercise this. Creativity needs to be nurtured, or it will diminish. I felt that happening last year, so I got off the train.</p><p>There will always be a bias towards choosing certain careers for monetary reasons or because of perceived status. They’re factors, for sure; no one can deny that. But they shouldn’t drive your intentions.</p><p>I’ll no longer do something just because it’s what’s expected of me. Because in that case, I’d be living someone else’s life, and not my own.</p></section><footer class="post-footer container container--narrow"><ul class="post-tag-list"><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/reflection/">reflection</a></li></ul></footer></article><article class="post" data-post-id="cim5n29d8003llm9izvfmt2ei"><header class="post-header container container--narrow"><a href="/2015/thoughts-from-taiwan/"><time class="post-date" datetime="2015-04-23T11:36:17.000Z">Thu, 23 Apr 2015</time><h1 class="post-title">Thoughts from Taiwan</h1></a></header><section class="post-content container container--narrow"><p>Food was the main theme.

It’s comfort food, after all. This time around, I especially enjoyed Pacific saury—I prefer fried, and eaten whole (including the head and bittersweet-tasting innards)—over rice. I also discovered the joys of eating guava out-of-hand. The inner portion, where the seeds are, is the best part—sweet, pungent, slimy, and slightly salty, in a good way.

It didn’t occur to me until I got there just how many websites were blocked. I felt helpless, being without a lot of the services I normally use—Google (maps, inbox, search), Dropbox, Twitter, Facebook. Now, though, I can much better appreciate the value these services provide on a daily basis.</p><p><strong>Manners</strong> in Chengdu are, well, different than they are in America. It was pretty noticeable. People there don’t cover their mouths when they cough. And seriously, they hock loogies like no other—everywhere you turn, there’s someone coughing loudly and spitting out phlegm onto the ground, in one fluid sequence.</p><p>In general, I found Chinese people to be very pushy also. If you’re waiting in line, for instance, they’re not afraid to just step in front of you. It’s a me-first mentality. They drive the same way, too.</p><p>Even once I got to Taiwan, I could tell Chinese from Taiwanese just by subtle differences in their manners.</p><p><strong>Seeing</strong> design artifacts from the Jinsha Ruins, of a culture that flourished over 3000 years ago, was pretty remarkable. Art doesn’t get better, maybe. Only the context changes.</p><p>Visiting Du Fu’s Thatched Cottage was interesting, too. I read about some of China’s past artists and poets, and it made me wonder if it was easier to live life as an artist back then than it is now.</p><p><strong>Nothing can compare</strong> to the <a href="https://youtu.be/OQSNhk5ICTI" target="_blank" rel="external">experience</a> of being amidst nature on such a grand scale, such as at Jiuzhaigou. Truly magical. Especially the waterfalls. But it was hard to be fully immersed when there were thousands of Chinese tourists there also, bustling around and being loud. To be deeply engaged in an activity, you really need time and space.</p><p>On one hand, it’s nice that the park is accessible to visitors—after all, I got to see it. But opening up Jiazhaigou, like any nature reserve, just means its eventual destruction, and that makes me sad. Roads and walkways are built. Buses and pollution are brought in. And inevitably, people will leave their trash (and even throw coins into the lakes).</p><p><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/4291520/journal-images/chengdu-trash.jpg" alt="This makes me sad."></p><p><strong>It’s important</strong> to enjoy who you work with (this seems to be a common theme during my travels), and might be the key for me to be happy in a career. During the Mount Qingcheng retreat, Randy and I got to know some of Robert’s co-workers—it helped that they were around our age—and it was definitely the most fun leg of the entire trip.</p><p>One girl in particular was really energetic, upbeat, and liked to joke around, and I got along especially well with her. Hanging out was natural, like we were already friends. I think someone like that would be a good fit for me, to complement my more reserved personality.</p><p><strong>Getting outside</strong> and hiking at Mount Qingcheng was a lot of fun. It felt wonderful to stretch my legs and get my heart rate up, and put me in a good mood the rest of the day. I think I was craving physical activity from being in the city all week. The outdoors and being active are still priorities for me, I realized.</p><p><strong>I got to see</strong> the diversity of Chinese people firsthand. It’s easy to underestimate just how huge the country is, both in size and population. On the Jiuzhaigou tour alone, we met people from a bunch of different provinces—Guangdong, Jiangsu, Beijing. And just walking around, I saw people from a lot of different ethnic groups, too. Growing up in America, you tend to see only certain types of Asians, which are really just a small subset of the total population.</p><p><strong>The food</strong> lived up to the hype. True to form, much of it was numbing and spicy. But it was all so good, and truly unique and special. Some dishes that left an impression on me:</p><ul><li>pao cai—sweet, sour, salty, spicy, with just the right amount of crunch</li><li>braised daikon</li><li>pig’s brain—I had it during spicy hot pot, and it was delicious; very tender</li><li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuqi_feipian" target="_blank" rel="external">fuqi feipian</a></li><li>mei cai kou rou</li><li>wood ear with pepperoncini</li><li>bamboo with ground pork</li><li>steamed bun with a spicy beef meatball filling</li><li>pork strips and red pepper in chili oil</li><li>sliced pork with marinated in fermented beans, chili oil</li><li>sausage in doubanjiang</li><li>red-cooked beef noodle soup</li><li>smoked fish</li><li>red-cooked gluten with celery strips, shiitake, and chili pepper</li><li>pan-fried bun with taro filling</li><li>brined bamboo</li><li>shoestring potatoes and green bell peppers</li><li>wood ear with sliced cucumber (a lot of dishes had wood ear)</li><li>cabbage—a variety with a softer crunch and sweeter taste</li><li>green beans—a more tender variety</li><li>clay pot cauliflower</li><li>lotus root and other liang ban in sesame chili oil</li><li>dandan noodles—preserved vegetables, minced pork, chili oil, scallions, peanuts</li></ul><p><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/4291520/journal-images/chengdu-food-1.jpg" alt="Dinner the first night: cucumber, water-cooked innards, braised daikon, and something else."><br><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/4291520/journal-images/chengdu-food-2.jpg" alt="Lunch with Randy&#39;s relatives.

There was a long layover in Taipei, so we bussed to Taoyuan and got breakfast.</p><p><em>March 13–15</em> (First weekend in Chengdu): Robert and Jie Jie showed us around the city (Kuanzhaixiangzi, Jinsha Ruins, Wuhou Shrine, Jinli Old Street, Chunxi Road) during these two days. We also ate well (spicy hot pot, dinner by the river, banquet lunch with Randy’s relatives) and generally just hung out (bookstore, Helen’s bar).</p><p><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/4291520/journal-images/chengdu-1-1.jpg" alt="Hanging out at Robert&#39;s apartment."><br><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/4291520/journal-images/chengdu-1-2.jpg" alt="Wuhou Shrine."><br><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/4291520/journal-images/chengdu-1-3.jpg" alt="Playing a dice game at Helen&#39;s bar."></p><p><em>March 16–18</em> (Jiuzhaigou): Randy’s uncle had booked a local Jiuzhaigou tour for us.

Friday, the four of us watched pandas eat bamboo at the Research Base for Giant Panda Breeding. That night, we played pool at a local expat bar.</p><p><em>March 21–22</em> (Weekend retreat): On Saturday, we took the train to Mount Qingcheng for a retreat with some of Robert’s co-workers. That night, we all got dinner and then relaxed in the hot springs. The next morning, we hiked.
