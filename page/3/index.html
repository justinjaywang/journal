I was supposed to take her to a Japanese restaurant (she’s from Japan), but it was closed for the holiday so we ate at a Taiwanese place nearby. In the evening, I met up with Randy, Brian, and Nasir for hot pot at Little Sheep, firework-watching at El Conejo Park, and then some beers at Randy’s.</p><p>Josh, Joyce, and I took a day trip to LA on the 5th to see a house concert for classical music. When we got back home, we had Souplantation for dinner with Kristina and her friend Tina.</p><p>The next couple of days, Josh and I hung out and played music together. We saw Youmi in the park on the 6th, and made dinner plans on the 7th, and invited her friend Leah, Randy, and Brian. We had a nice dinner at a Cuban restaurant at the Lab in Costa Mesa.</p><p>I drove up to Venice on the 9th to visit an old friend from Berkeley, Bez; he’s been working at a startup on Abbot Kinney, so we had a chat and he showed me around.</p><p>On the 11th, Brian stopped by in the late afternoon to play around with Josh’s drum machine. Randy and Tiffany came over after dinner; the three of us took a stroll in the park around sunset and then listened to music afterwards.</p><p>During this time, I had also been talking with <a href="http://oak.is" target="_blank" rel="external">Oak</a>, a design studio in New York. I’d been following their work for a some time, and by chance I emailed them late last month when I saw they had an internship opening. Last weekend, I told them I wanted to take it.</p><p>The job lasts three months. I leave on Sunday, and start on Monday.</p></section><footer class="post-footer container container--narrow"><ul class="post-tag-list"><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/oc/">oc</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/daily/">daily</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/july-4th/">july 4th</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/los-angeles/">los angeles</a></li></ul></footer></article><article class="post" data-post-id="cizb91s3e0092hvvxh3oji0e0"><header class="post-header container container--narrow"><a href="/2015/duanwu-festival-and-meetups/"><time class="post-date" datetime="2015-06-30T01:36:08.000Z">Mon, 29 Jun 2015</time><h1 class="post-title">Duanwu Festival and meetups</h1></a></header><section class="post-content container container--narrow"><ul><li>watching basketball with Mom</li><li>jam session with Tiffany and Randy; it was a trip relive all the old tunes I used to play and listen to; I keep saying it, but it bears repeating: music used to be such a big part of my life, and I don’t want to lose it</li><li>social event at a bar in Long Beach, where I met some other OC designers</li><li>potluck dinner at Uncle Ray’s for the Duanwu Festival; I ate two zongzis</li><li>tacos with Alex at Perla’s</li><li>developers meetup in Venice; I wanted to see an apartment showing closer to downtown earlier in the day, so I made a day of it; I saw the La Brea Tar Pits, walked along Venice Beach, and had a really delicious lunch in Koreatown</li><li>baseball game with Tiffany; they now have a special Metrolink train for Angels games, so we took that</li><li>watching old episodes of <em>Community</em>; I admit I’m not immune to distractions, but I don’t mind as much any more; just trying to go with the flow</li></ul><p><img src="/images/koreatown-lunch.jpg" alt="Lunch in Koreatown—grilled mackerel pike."></p></section><footer class="post-footer container container--narrow"><ul class="post-tag-list"><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/oc/">oc</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/daily/">daily</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/food/">food</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/los-angeles/">los angeles</a></li></ul></footer></article><article class="post" data-post-id="cizb91s3d008zhvvxtlk1kfxg"><header class="post-header container container--narrow"><a href="/2015/reading/"><time class="post-date" datetime="2015-06-10T14:12:41.000Z">Wed, 10 Jun 2015</time><h1 class="post-title">Reading</h1></a></header><section class="post-content container container--narrow"><p>I’ve been doing a lot of design reading lately. It started when I was in San Jose and would go to the library to browse books for inspiration. Now I can’t get enough.</p><p>A couple weeks ago, I read the comprehensive <em>Meggs’ History of Graphic Design</em>. I never got a formal design education, so I wanted to get a solid foundation and put things in perspective historically. It was interesting to see which designs have stood the test of time and which designs look dated, in a bad way.</p><p>I also checked out a couple of information design books from the public library, <em>Envisioning Information</em> and <em>Beautiful Evidence</em> by Edward R. Tufte. He’s a big proponent of content. If the numbers are boring, then you’ve got the wrong numbers. And clutter is a failure of design, not an attribute of information; but, visual problems shouldn’t be fixed by sacrificing the resolution of the content.</p><p>One chapter from <em>Beautiful Evidence</em> really got to me in particular. It talked about the inherent problems of PowerPoint presentations—good for the confidence of bad presenters (who either don’t know what to say, or worse, don’t really have anything of substance to say), but horrible as a means of communicating something to an audience.</p><p>It’s just that people see, think, and read all the time at intensities greater than watching bulleted list items appear one by one on slide sequences. No wonder I never learned anything from listening to those crappy, templated PowerPoints that teachers and students presented in school. I only ever learned by (1) reading the textbook or (2) practicing or doing.</p><p>The issue is that PowerPoint presentations are used as a substitute for real thought. Smatterings of somewhat related words and phrases are certainly easier than writing full sentences.</p><p>We’ve gotten to a place as a society where we no longer want to think. We just want to mindlessly consume. You see it on the Internet, in the form of short, 140-character bursts of opinion and endless click-bait articles. Everything is dumbed down for us. Time is rarely left for deep thought, which is required for meaningful communication.</p><hr><p>When not reading, I’ve been working on building my personal brand—I designed and coded up my homepage and portfolio, and created themes for documents and presentations. I’ve just begun to reach out to people who’ve contacted me in the past about freelance work that I had to turn down while I was working on other projects.</p><p>For exercise, I’ve been going on walks (and sometimes uphill sprints) along the trails behind El Conejo Park and working on my jump shot in the side yard.</p><p>For food, I’ve been mostly cooking, still—dishes like braised gluten and shiitake, pork belly, slow-roasted chicken, carrot and potato fries, omelettes, and Asian greens from the farmer’s market. I also got a burger (not that good) at dinner with Brian, Randy, and Tariq for Brian’s birthday. Jen was in town this past weekend. She, Mom, and I went out to lunch with Tiffany and her mom at Hsi Lai Temple.</p><p>For entertainment, I’ve been watching the NBA playoffs with Mom. I get so emotionally invested in the games, but I’m trying not to. I take Warriors losses pretty hard, in part because I feel like I’ve grown up with this team. They’re down 2–1 right now in the finals. We’ll see how they respond.</p></section><footer class="post-footer container container--narrow"><ul class="post-tag-list"><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/reflection/">reflection</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/oc/">oc</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/daily/">daily</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/books/">books</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/food/">food</a></li></ul></footer></article><article class="post" data-post-id="cizb91s3c008xhvvxecpsu8kq"><header class="post-header container container--narrow"><a href="/2015/new-outlook/"><time class="post-date" datetime="2015-06-10T04:06:10.000Z">Wed, 10 Jun 2015</time><h1 class="post-title">New outlook</h1></a></header><section class="post-content container container--narrow"><p>Ten months ago, I reconnected with an old friend from school; I’d always had a crush on her but she always seemed to have a boyfriend. Things eventually ended between us, but the experience changed me. It changed my outlook on life. It made me see that, well, good things really can happen. I never thought they could happen to me, until they did. Sounds cheesy, but it’s true.</p><p>At that time, I kept coming back to this thought of “Why not me?” Since then, I’ve made some bold decisions. Other people have taken chances and pursued their passions. Why not me?

Then I’d have skills and resources to pursue freelancing.</p><p>The thing is, after searching for jobs for a while, I’m just not sure there’s a conventional job that I would like. At least, they’d be hard to come by. But why invest the time and energy into finding out? My new plan now is to skip the “get more experience” step and just start freelancing—it was my eventual goal, so I might as well start making mistakes and learning from them, sooner rather than later. Anything I need to learn I can learn as I go, I feel. As far as meeting people and growing my network, there are meetups and professional organizations, like AIGA.</p><p>I’m betting on myself, and trusting that if you do good work, people will notice.</p></section><footer class="post-footer container container--narrow"><ul class="post-tag-list"><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/reflection/">reflection</a></li></ul></footer></article><article class="post" data-post-id="cizb91s39008shvvxrmz3mgib"><header class="post-header container container--narrow"><a href="/2015/post-trip/"><time class="post-date" datetime="2015-05-25T13:02:24.000Z">Mon, 25 May 2015</time><h1 class="post-title">Post-trip</h1></a></header><section class="post-content container container--narrow"><p>Since Taiwan and China, I’ve been at home looking for jobs, cooking, and going on walks.

My mindset was: <em>work hard, get through school, find a job, and you’ll be happy</em>. As long as I earned a stable income, a job was just a job.</p><p>As it turns out, that was a very narrow outlook. Happiness, after all, lies in your day-to-day experience. How you’re spending time on a routine workday matters just as much as when you’re on vacation. My mindset now is: <em>find a job you love</em>. This means doing work that’s meaningful and rewarding, and with people I like being around.</p><p>I have a lot of skills and interests. But I realize that I can’t pursue everything I’m interested in—there’s just not enough time. The way our society is set up, it’s optimal to choose one profession, and learn to do it well.</p><p>Choosing the right path is hard. Only a select few get it right on their first try. For most people, it takes considerable exploration to find your purpose.</p><p>For me, when I look at the big picture, what is it that really separates me from other people? It’s my creative ability. Always has been, ever since I was little. I’d be doing a disservice to myself by working at a place where I’m not able to fully exercise this. Creativity needs to be nurtured, or it will diminish. I felt that happening last year, so I got off the train.</p><p>There will always be a bias towards choosing certain careers for monetary reasons or because of perceived status. They’re factors, for sure; no one can deny that. But they shouldn’t drive your intentions.</p><p>I’ll no longer do something just because it’s what’s expected of me. Because in that case, I’d be living someone else’s life, and not my own.</p></section><footer class="post-footer container container--narrow"><ul class="post-tag-list"><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/reflection/">reflection</a></li></ul></footer></article><article class="post" data-post-id="cizb91s37008nhvvx14k73c9m"><header class="post-header container container--narrow"><a href="/2015/thoughts-from-taiwan/"><time class="post-date" datetime="2015-04-23T11:36:17.000Z">Thu, 23 Apr 2015</time><h1 class="post-title">Thoughts from Taiwan</h1></a></header><section class="post-content container container--narrow"><p>Food was the main theme.

It’s comfort food, after all. This time around, I especially enjoyed Pacific saury—I prefer fried, and eaten whole (including the head and bittersweet-tasting innards)—over rice.
