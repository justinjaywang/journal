My mindset was: <em>work hard, get through school, find a job, and you’ll be happy</em>. As long as I earned a stable income, a job was just a job.</p><p>As it turns out, that was a very narrow outlook. Happiness, after all, lies in your day-to-day experience. How you’re spending time on a routine workday matters just as much as when you’re on vacation. My mindset now is: <em>find a job you love</em>. This means doing work that’s meaningful and rewarding, and with people I like being around.</p><p>I have a lot of skills and interests. But I realize that I can’t pursue everything I’m interested in—there’s just not enough time. The way our society is set up, it’s optimal to choose one profession, and learn to do it well.</p><p>Choosing the right path is hard. Only a select few get it right on their first try. For most people, it takes considerable exploration to find your purpose.</p><p>For me, when I look at the big picture, what is it that really separates me from other people? It’s my creative ability. Always has been, ever since I was little. I’d be doing a disservice to myself by working at a place where I’m not able to fully exercise this. Creativity needs to be nurtured, or it will diminish. I felt that happening last year, so I got off the train.</p><p>There will always be a bias towards choosing certain careers for monetary reasons or because of perceived status. They’re factors, for sure; no one can deny that. But they shouldn’t drive your intentions.</p><p>I’ll no longer do something just because it’s what’s expected of me. Because in that case, I’d be living someone else’s life, and not my own.</p></section><footer class="post-footer container container--narrow"><ul class="post-tag-list"><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/reflection/">reflection</a></li></ul></footer></article><article class="post" data-post-id="cijkgmp99002yp9xq08lwh7gm"><header class="post-header container container--narrow"><a href="/2015/thoughts-from-taiwan/"><time class="post-date" datetime="2015-04-23T11:36:17.000Z">Thu, 23 Apr 2015</time><h1 class="post-title">Thoughts from Taiwan</h1></a></header><section class="post-content container container--narrow"><p>Food was the main theme. I had originally planned on stopping by Taipei for a just few days on the way back to America from Chengdu, but I suggested that Mom come and spend time with me there, where we could bond over food—eat some of our favorite dishes, try new ones, and get inspired.</p><p>Chengdu food was incredible, but Taiwanese is still my absolute favorite. It’s comfort food, after all. This time around, I especially enjoyed Pacific saury—I prefer fried, and eaten whole (including the head and bittersweet-tasting innards)—over rice.

It didn’t occur to me until I got there just how many websites were blocked. I felt helpless, being without a lot of the services I normally use—Google (maps, inbox, search), Dropbox, Twitter, Facebook. Now, though, I can much better appreciate the value these services provide on a daily basis.</p><p><strong>Manners</strong> in Chengdu are, well, different than they are in America. It was pretty noticeable. People there don’t cover their mouths when they cough. And seriously, they hock loogies like no other—everywhere you turn, there’s someone coughing loudly and spitting out phlegm onto the ground, in one fluid sequence.</p><p>In general, I found Chinese people to be very pushy also. If you’re waiting in line, for instance, they’re not afraid to just step in front of you. It’s a me-first mentality. They drive the same way, too.</p><p>Even once I got to Taiwan, I could tell Chinese from Taiwanese just by subtle differences in their manners.</p><p><strong>Seeing</strong> design artifacts from the Jinsha Ruins, of a culture that flourished over 3000 years ago, was pretty remarkable. Art doesn’t get better, maybe. Only the context changes.</p><p>Visiting Du Fu’s Thatched Cottage was interesting, too. I read about some of China’s past artists and poets, and it made me wonder if it was easier to live life as an artist back then than it is now.</p><p><strong>Nothing can compare</strong> to the <a href="https://youtu.be/OQSNhk5ICTI" target="_blank" rel="external">experience</a> of being amidst nature on such a grand scale, such as at Jiuzhaigou. Truly magical. Especially the waterfalls. But it was hard to be fully immersed when there were thousands of Chinese tourists there also, bustling around and being loud. To be deeply engaged in an activity, you really need time and space.</p><p>On one hand, it’s nice that the park is accessible to visitors—after all, I got to see it. But opening up Jiazhaigou, like any nature reserve, just means its eventual destruction, and that makes me sad. Roads and walkways are built. Buses and pollution are brought in. And inevitably, people will leave their trash (and even throw coins into the lakes).</p><p><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/4291520/journal-images/chengdu-trash.jpg" alt="This makes me sad."></p><p><strong>It’s important</strong> to enjoy who you work with (this seems to be a common theme during my travels), and might be the key for me to be happy in a career. During the Mount Qingcheng retreat, Randy and I got to know some of Robert’s co-workers—it helped that they were around our age—and it was definitely the most fun leg of the entire trip.</p><p>One girl in particular was really energetic, upbeat, and liked to joke around, and I got along especially well with her. Hanging out was natural, like we were already friends. I think someone like that would be a good fit for me, to complement my more reserved personality.</p><p><strong>Getting outside</strong> and hiking at Mount Qingcheng was a lot of fun. It felt wonderful to stretch my legs and get my heart rate up, and put me in a good mood the rest of the day. I think I was craving physical activity from being in the city all week. The outdoors and being active are still priorities for me, I realized.</p><p><strong>I got to see</strong> the diversity of Chinese people firsthand. It’s easy to underestimate just how huge the country is, both in size and population. On the Jiuzhaigou tour alone, we met people from a bunch of different provinces—Guangdong, Jiangsu, Beijing. And just walking around, I saw people from a lot of different ethnic groups, too. Growing up in America, you tend to see only certain types of Asians, which are really just a small subset of the total population.</p><p><strong>The food</strong> lived up to the hype. True to form, much of it was numbing and spicy. But it was all so good, and truly unique and special. Some dishes that left an impression on me:</p><ul><li>pao cai—sweet, sour, salty, spicy, with just the right amount of crunch</li><li>braised daikon</li><li>pig’s brain—I had it during spicy hot pot, and it was delicious; very tender</li><li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuqi_feipian" target="_blank" rel="external">fuqi feipian</a></li><li>mei cai kou rou</li><li>wood ear with pepperoncini</li><li>bamboo with ground pork</li><li>steamed bun with a spicy beef meatball filling</li><li>pork strips and red pepper in chili oil</li><li>sliced pork with marinated in fermented beans, chili oil</li><li>sausage in doubanjiang</li><li>red-cooked beef noodle soup</li><li>smoked fish</li><li>red-cooked gluten with celery strips, shiitake, and chili pepper</li><li>pan-fried bun with taro filling</li><li>brined bamboo</li><li>shoestring potatoes and green bell peppers</li><li>wood ear with sliced cucumber (a lot of dishes had wood ear)</li><li>cabbage—a variety with a softer crunch and sweeter taste</li><li>green beans—a more tender variety</li><li>clay pot cauliflower</li><li>lotus root and other liang ban in sesame chili oil</li><li>dandan noodles—preserved vegetables, minced pork, chili oil, scallions, peanuts</li></ul><p><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/4291520/journal-images/chengdu-food-1.jpg" alt="Dinner the first night: cucumber, water-cooked innards, braised daikon, and something else."><br><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/4291520/journal-images/chengdu-food-2.jpg" alt="Lunch with Randy&#39;s relatives.

I took Mom and Tiffany’s mom walking at the regional park and we had Souplantation afterwards; Kaju Soft Tofu in Irvine with Mom before we went grocery shopping at 99 Ranch; California Fish Grill with Randy, Brian, and Nasir; and on Chinese New Year’s Eve, Mom and I had hot pot for dinner at Uncle Ray’s.</p><p>I’ve also been going on walks, reading, researching jobs, doing push-ups, shooting hoops in the side yard, catching the NBA and Modern Family on TV, listening to podcasts, and playing piano (Youth Lagoon and Bruno Mars).</p><p><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/4291520/journal-images/hummingbird.jpg" alt="A hummingbird who wanted to read my portfolio."></p></section><footer class="post-footer container container--narrow"><ul class="post-tag-list"><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/chinese-new-year/">chinese new year</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/daily/">daily</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/food/">food</a></li></ul></footer></article><article class="post" data-post-id="cijkgmp9r003wp9xqp1rtht8a"><header class="post-header container container--narrow"><a href="/2015/post-philippines/"><time class="post-date" datetime="2015-02-16T02:46:12.000Z">Sun, 15 Feb 2015</time><h1 class="post-title">Post-Philippines</h1></a></header><section class="post-content container container--narrow"><p><em>Cooking</em></p><ul><li>napa with black bean, or with tiny shrimp</li><li>cabbage, sometimes with tomato and onion</li><li>fried dried fish that I brought back from the Philippines</li><li>rice congee with chicken</li><li>roasted sweet potato</li><li>hongshao rou</li><li>celery and wood ear mushroom cold dish</li><li>cauliflower</li><li>cucumber xiao cai, cut into matchsticks</li><li>tomato and cabbage with caramelized onions</li><li>dry-fried green beans, with ground pork</li><li>fried tofu with scallions</li><li>green bell pepper</li><li>beef shank and cat ear noodle soup</li><li>bibimbap using the clay bowl my old roommates gave to me</li><li>huagua pickles</li><li>lu rou</li><li>asparagus</li><li>soy-braised carrot, daikon, napa, potato</li><li>omelette with salted turnip</li></ul><p><em>Non-cooking</em></p><ul><li>working on my portfolio and some more monograms</li><li>read Eddie Huang’s memoir, <em>Fresh Off the Boat</em></li><li>watched <em>Better Luck Tomorrow</em></li><li>moved basketball hoop to side yard</li><li>daily walks (and sprints up hills)</li><li>preparing for Asia trip</li><li>ate out two times: Korean with Randy; and Vietnamese with Brian, Randy, and Nasir</li></ul></section><footer class="post-footer container container--narrow"><ul class="post-tag-list"><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/daily/">daily</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/food/">food</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/philippines/">philippines</a></li></ul></footer></article></main><footer class="page-footer"><nav class="nav nav--pagination"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="nav-item"><a href="/page/2/" class="nav-link">Previous</a></li><li class="nav-item"><a href="/page/2/" class="nav-link nav-link--center">3 of 15</a></li><li class="nav-item"><a href="/page/4/" class="nav-link">Next</a></li></ul></nav></footer><script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.0.3/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/js/all.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">!function(e,a,t,n,c,o,s){e.GoogleAnalyticsObject=c,e[c]=e[c]||function(){(e[c].q=e[c].q||[]).push(arguments)},e[c].l=1*new Date,o=a.createElement(t),s=a.getElementsByTagName(t)[0],o.async=1,o.src=n,s.parentNode.insertBefore(o,s)}(window,document,"script","//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js","ga"),ga("create","UA-15132368-5","auto"),ga("send","pageview");</script></body></html>
