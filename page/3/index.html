For meals, I was cooking a lot of what I had left over, including a risotto of sorts, with brown rice and chicken stock.</p><p>On Saturday, I had Koryo for dinner with Akina and played board games afterwards at Theresa’s house with Jason, Irena, and some of their friends.

It had some interesting stuff, and I always enjoy thinking holistically about digital interfaces. It keeps me inspired. I also went through some of my bookmarked Medium articles.</p><p>This week, I updated and themed my <a href="http://justinjaywang.tumblr.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Tumblr blog</a> and moved my journal from Scriptogram to a <a href="http://hexo.io/" target="_blank" rel="external">Hexo</a>-generated static site hosted on GitHub pages.

After basketball on Thursday evening, I invited Jen and Brendan over for dinner. I made lu rou fan with fried tofu, preserved turnip omelette, and cabbage.</p><p>Lately, I’ve been cooking a lot with freezer and pantry ingredients so I can use them up before I move back to SoCal. Just like in <em>Chopped</em>, the constraints with which I had to work forced me to be creative with what dishes I made. My favorites were (1) tuna fried rice with a frozen vegetable mix of green beans, corn, peas, and carrots and (2) an anchovy and chive tomato sauce that I ate over rice.</p></section><footer class="post-footer container container--narrow"><ul class="post-tag-list"><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/daily/">daily</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/food/">food</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/marin/">marin</a></li></ul></footer></article></main><footer class="page-footer"><nav class="nav nav--pagination"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="nav-item"><a href="/page/2/" class="nav-link">Previous</a></li><li class="nav-item"><a href="/page/2/" class="nav-link nav-link--center">3 of 14</a></li><li class="nav-item"><a href="/page/4/" class="nav-link">Next</a></li></ul></nav></footer><script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.0.3/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/js/all.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">!function(e,a,t,n,c,o,s){e.GoogleAnalyticsObject=c,e[c]=e[c]||function(){(e[c].q=e[c].q||[]).push(arguments)},e[c].l=1*new Date,o=a.createElement(t),s=a.getElementsByTagName(t)[0],o.async=1,o.src=n,s.parentNode.insertBefore(o,s)}(window,document,"script","//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js","ga"),ga("create","UA-15132368-6","auto"),ga("send","pageview");</script></body></html>
