We ate meals, played sports, and sang karaoke together. I saw where they lived and where they worked. And I saw their favorite hangout spots. As a result, I feel I have a much better sense of the local culture than I would have otherwise. Plus, now I have friends in the Philippines, which is pretty cool.</li><li>Being away from the social world of back home was a breath of fresh air. I saw how liberating it can be to not care what anyone thinks. There was no reason to be self-conscious or shy, especially since everyone was so warm, flattering, and engaging—they were so excited when they first met me. Just be you, and you’ll have fun.</li><li>Seeing the infrastructure there and the way certain things operate gives me more of an appreciation for things that I’ve probably taken for granted, growing up where I have. They’re simple things, like: the ability to walk around a city and feel safe, clean air, people that actually try to help you if you ask a question, and service workers that give any shit. Just to name a few.</li><li>Don’t take parents for granted. While I still can, I should get to know Dad as much as possible (especially times when we’re on the same continent). During this trip, I came a little closer to understanding some of his motivations. We’re alike in a lot of ways; learning about him is partly learning about myself also.</li><li>I’m fortunate for what I have. Not only did I have the means to travel to a foreign country—which not a lot of people in the world can claim—but I had the time away from work to do so via the freedom to quit my job and be selective with my career. I know I’m spoiled in many ways. The best I can do, then, is try to be happy and show appreciation to those who have worked hard to put me in this situation.</li></ol></section><footer class="post-footer container container--narrow"><ul class="post-tag-list"><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/philippines/">philippines</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/reflection/">reflection</a></li></ul></footer></article><article class="post" data-post-id="ciggye4v8003idw0hjf3fyx2y"><header class="post-header container container--narrow"><a href="/2015/philippines/"><time class="post-date" datetime="2015-01-28T21:44:42.000Z">Wed, 28 Jan 2015</time><h1 class="post-title">Philippines</h1></a></header><section class="post-content container container--narrow"><p>The journey to the Philippines took over a full day, and involved stops in Taipei and Manila, China Airlines seafood meals, a bag of homemade trail mix, listening to music, naps, and getting moved to a later flight to Cebu—luckily, I met someone nice enough to let me use her phone to notify Dad.</p><p><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/4291520/journal-images/philippines-1.jpg" alt="Layover in Taipei&#39;s Taoyuan Airport."></p><p><strong>Thursday</strong>—First night in the Philippines.

Afterwards, we walked around and most of them got their faces painted.</p><p>For dinner, we ate lechón belly with puso (hanging rice) and a glass of Coke. More wandering around after dinner. The scene was surreal. By then, the sun had gone down and the streets became the setting for one huge rave. I made it out, but not without a paint-covered face to show for it. The final stop of the night was karaoke, which was the highlight of the entire day. At midnight, we rode a jeepney back to City Lights and they walked me to the gate.</p><p><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/4291520/journal-images/philippines-3.jpg" alt="Making our way through the crowded streets."><br><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/4291520/journal-images/philippines-4.jpg" alt="Paint-covered Sinulog-goers."></p><p><strong>Monday</strong>—Walked around one of Cebu’s giant malls, Ayala.

The day was spent riding on a jeepney to and from the harbor, boating from island to island (three total, I think), swimming with fish, and braving the cold weather. We ate lunch on the boat, too: rice, lumpia, marinated pork belly, kinilaw, shrimp, yams, and dried calamari.</p><p><strong>Sunday</strong>—Lunch at a dim sum restaurant.
