I call these periods “happiness islands”. Try it for yourself. Ask what the happiness islands have in common—why were you unusually happy then. You can do the same for your “achievement islands”—and for the opposites too, the times when you were least effective (“achievement desert islands”) or happy (“happiness desert islands”).</p></blockquote><p>I’ve been thinking a lot about my Happiness Islands lately. What do they all have in common? Friends and family—people who understand me. And a lot of times, food. Playing sports, or getting exercise, too.</p></section><footer class="post-footer container container--narrow"><ul class="post-tag-list"><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/reflection/">reflection</a></li></ul></footer></article><article class="post" data-post-id="ciezqlhy2008sqj0htg2flnif"><header class="post-header container container--narrow"><a href="/2014/rained-out/"><time class="post-date" datetime="2014-03-04T08:00:00.000Z">Tue, 4 Mar 2014</time><h1 class="post-title">Rained out</h1></a></header><section class="post-content container container--narrow"><p>I’ve been working on my portfolio this past week; had a goal to finish by the end of the weekend and succeeded.
