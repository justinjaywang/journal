I tagged along, and was surprised that it came somewhat easily to me. Granted, we weren’t running at record speeds, but I was surprisingly good given that I had barely any long distance running experience before that. You tend to enjoy things you’re good at, making it all the more important to try new things.</p><p>I ran four times out of five this past work week and, like everything I do, I want to do it as best as I can. I’m currently focused on improving my form and getting faster.</p><p>Each run is about 4 miles; there are variations on the route, but they all go through a scenic part of town, along the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@37.915408,-122.383009,15z" target="_blank" rel="external">shoreline</a>. During the runs, I’m thankful to be where working where I am. Running also gives me a chance to clear my mind, and refocus for the rest of the day. I feel great afterwards.</p><p>I met Jill and Akina for dinner on separate occasions this past week, at <a href="http://www.athineon1.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Athineon</a> and <a href="http://www.bowldsolano.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Bowl’d</a>, respectively.</p><p>This weekend was spent watching sports, eating, and sleeping. I also got a new pair of Nike running shoes earlier today.</p></section><footer class="post-footer container container--narrow"><ul class="post-tag-list"><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/daily/">daily</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/reflection/">reflection</a></li></ul></footer></article><article class="post" data-post-id="cipfeu01g008oad9iclpx2pwf"><header class="post-header container container--narrow"><a href="/2014/memorial-day-weekend/"><time class="post-date" datetime="2014-05-28T04:00:00.000Z">Wed, 28 May 2014</time><h1 class="post-title">Memorial Day weekend</h1></a></header><section class="post-content container container--narrow"><p>Spent the long weekend plus Tuesday with family.
