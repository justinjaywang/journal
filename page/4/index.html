We ate meals, played sports, and sang karaoke together. I saw where they lived and where they worked. And I saw their favorite hangout spots. As a result, I feel I have a much better sense of the local culture than I would have otherwise. Plus, now I have friends in the Philippines, which is pretty cool.</li><li>Being away from the social world of back home was a breath of fresh air. I saw how liberating it can be to not care what anyone thinks. There was no reason to be self-conscious or shy, especially since everyone was so warm, flattering, and engaging—they were so excited when they first met me. Just be you, and you’ll have fun.</li><li>Seeing the infrastructure there and the way certain things operate gives me more of an appreciation for things that I’ve probably taken for granted, growing up where I have. They’re simple things, like: the ability to walk around a city and feel safe, clean air, people that actually try to help you if you ask a question, and service workers that give any shit. Just to name a few.</li><li>Don’t take parents for granted. While I still can, I should get to know Dad as much as possible (especially times when we’re on the same continent). During this trip, I came a little closer to understanding some of his motivations. We’re alike in a lot of ways; learning about him is partly learning about myself also.</li><li>I’m fortunate for what I have. Not only did I have the means to travel to a foreign country—which not a lot of people in the world can claim—but I had the time away from work to do so via the freedom to quit my job and be selective with my career. I know I’m spoiled in many ways. The best I can do, then, is try to be happy and show appreciation to those who have worked hard to put me in this situation.</li></ol></section><footer class="post-footer container container--narrow"><ul class="post-tag-list"><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/philippines/">philippines</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/reflection/">reflection</a></li></ul></footer></article><article class="post" data-post-id="cikoed348004m0b6tezrfd7yr"><header class="post-header container container--narrow"><a href="/2015/philippines/"><time class="post-date" datetime="2015-01-28T18:44:42.000Z">Wed, 28 Jan 2015</time><h1 class="post-title">Philippines</h1></a></header><section class="post-content container container--narrow"><p>The journey to the Philippines took over a full day, and involved stops in Taipei and Manila, China Airlines seafood meals, a bag of homemade trail mix, listening to music, naps, and getting moved to a later flight to Cebu—luckily, I met someone nice enough to let me use her phone to notify Dad.</p><p><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/4291520/journal-images/philippines-1.jpg" alt="Layover in Taipei&#39;s Taoyuan Airport."></p><p><strong>Thursday</strong>—First night in the Philippines. Dinner at <em>Casa Verde</em> for spare ribs and roasted chicken.</p><p><strong>Friday</strong>—At the office for most of the day. Volleyball in the evening. After dinner at home, Dad and I attended a company party at the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Crown+Regency+Residences+Cebu/@10.3185,123.885,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x33a99ecc616da429:0x21c897fd84fba463" target="_blank" rel="external">Crown Regency</a>, where there was a bar and karaoke. I made plans with some of the employees to go out on Sunday for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinulog" target="_blank" rel="external">Sinulog</a> festival.</p><p><strong>Saturday</strong>—Trip to the Filipino Costco, called S&amp;R, in the morning. It was interesting seeing what produce and products they had for sale. Basketball in the evening, then dumplings for dinner.</p><p><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/4291520/journal-images/philippines-2.jpg" alt="Seafood for sale at S&amp;R."></p><p><strong>Sunday</strong>—Met up with my new friends in the late morning to attend the Sinulog festivities. We watched the parade from a grandstand while I tried some new foods, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokneneng" target="_blank" rel="external">kwek kwek</a> and green mango dipped in shrimp paste. Afterwards, we walked around and most of them got their faces painted.</p><p>For dinner, we ate lechón belly with puso (hanging rice) and a glass of Coke. More wandering around after dinner. The scene was surreal. By then, the sun had gone down and the streets became the setting for one huge rave. I made it out, but not without a paint-covered face to show for it. The final stop of the night was karaoke, which was the highlight of the entire day. At midnight, we rode a jeepney back to City Lights and they walked me to the gate.</p><p><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/4291520/journal-images/philippines-3.jpg" alt="Making our way through the crowded streets."><br><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/4291520/journal-images/philippines-4.jpg" alt="Paint-covered Sinulog-goers."></p><p><strong>Monday</strong>—Walked around one of Cebu’s giant malls, Ayala. Shot some hoops downstairs. For dinner, we had some more Filipino cuisine: crispy pata, mongo soup, and kare-kare.</p><p><strong>Tuesday</strong>—Dad and I took a short trip to the recently-opened CallTek office in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Santos" target="_blank" rel="external">General Santos</a>. Lunch at a café near the hotel, consisting of Filipino fare: tuna sisig, chicken adobo, and pinakbet. Afterwards, we scoured the malls, looking for furniture and appliances for the new office. Dinner: crab and grilled tuna belly.</p><p><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/4291520/journal-images/philippines-5.jpg" alt="GenSan&#39;s main highway."><br><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/4291520/journal-images/philippines-6.jpg" alt="Riding on a tricycle, GenSan&#39;s primary mode of public transport."></p><p><strong>Wednesday</strong>—In the early morning, I met some more company people over breakfast at McDonald’s—they’re over in GenSan training new employees. We also had dinner together, a seafood feast at Tiongson Arcade: grilled tuna jaw, tuna roe, fried calamari, lechón kawali with julienned green mango, and shrimp sinigang.</p><p><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/4291520/journal-images/philippines-7.jpg" alt="Seafood at Tiongson Arcade.

I played volleyball again in the afternoon. I then treated to dinner the people who took care of me during Sinulog—Derek, Lance, Honey, Xyza, Asha, Angel, Nel, Bless, and Linda.</p><p><strong>Saturday</strong>—Island hopping with Dad, some of his friends, and some company people. The day was spent riding on a jeepney to and from the harbor, boating from island to island (three total, I think), swimming with fish, and braving the cold weather. We ate lunch on the boat, too: rice, lumpia, marinated pork belly, kinilaw, shrimp, yams, and dried calamari.</p><p><strong>Sunday</strong>—Lunch at a dim sum restaurant. Afterwards, a long nap—my body was telling me I needed to rest.</p><p><strong>Monday</strong>—Travel.</p></section><footer class="post-footer container container--narrow"><ul class="post-tag-list"><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/daily/">daily</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/food/">food</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/philippines/">philippines</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/vacation/">vacation</a></li></ul></footer></article><article class="post" data-post-id="cikoed34h004r0b6t3ads2irm"><header class="post-header container container--narrow"><a href="/2015/bread/"><time class="post-date" datetime="2015-01-13T16:30:44.000Z">Tue, 13 Jan 2015</time><h1 class="post-title">Bread</h1></a></header><section class="post-content container container--narrow"><p><em>Walks</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;Top of the World hike with Randy, Byron, and Tiffany; Jordan Market to get groceries; a solo all-morning hike around Aliso and Wood Canyons Wilderness Park.</p><p><em>Eating out</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hot pot with the cousins and cousins of cousins; Spicy City with Randy, Josh, Tiffany, and Byron; Souplantation with Mom.</p><p><em>Eating in</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;Whole wheat bread variations with cranberry, walnuts, orange zest, and muesli; scallion pancakes; steamed and baked buns; kumquat bread; bread with jalapeño, pancakes with strawberries, almonds, figs, cranberries; Japanese eggplant in the style of dry-fried green beans; sesame coleslaw; cabbage with preserved black bean; pork soup with cucumber; <em>hongshao rou</em>.</p><hr><p>Randy, Tiffany, and I also watched <em>Frances Ha</em> together.
