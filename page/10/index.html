Fridays nights are sacred; they’re Justin time. No offense, but I feel like I could be doing something more productive. This trend dates back to my college days, when I almost always regretted going to parties and would have rather have spent the time improving my skills, such as playing guitar. I think I’m just different in this way.</p><p>I love nights where I’m feeling inspired and my mind is swimming. Tonight is one of those nights. It started with the question “Who do I want to be in five years?” and the realization that I need to be more disciplined to achieve my vision. I can’t lose sight of who I am and who I want to be. So I sent an email to myself, 5 years in <a href="http://www.futureme.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">the future</a> as a checkpoint.</p><p>I also came across ideas for <a href="http://www.stumbleupon.com/su/1GDCAp/:1uZG5T2Sq:qTeKzgqt/www.highexistence.com/30-challenges-for-30-days/" target="_blank" rel="external">challenges</a> that was inspired by Matt Cutt’s <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/matt_cutts_try_something_new_for_30_days.html" target="_blank" rel="external">TED talk</a> about trying something new for 30 days.</p><p>If there’s something I’d like to change about myself or I just want to form a good habit, nothing’s stopping me. So I might as well do it as soon as possible. These are the challenges I chose:</p><ul><li>Take a walk each day. I can easily accomplish this by walking into town on work days, or in the evenings to Trader Joe’s.</li><li>Take a cold shower each day. Or when I do take a shower, make it a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shower#Scottish_shower" target="_blank" rel="external">Scottish shower</a>. Acccording to many sources they have real <a href="http://www.artofmanliness.com/2010/01/18/the-james-bond-shower-a-shot-of-cold-water-for-health-and-vitality/" target="_blank" rel="external">health benefits</a>.</li><li>Keep a dream journal. I’ve been dreaming a lot lately. I briefly flirted with writing my dreams a couple years ago, but didn’t keep it up.</li><li>100 push ups each day. I’ve already been doing this for the last two weeks.</li><li>Be honest, to myself and to others.</li></ul><p>These can start off as 30 day challenges, but can easily become lifelong habits.</p></section><footer class="post-footer container container--narrow"><ul class="post-tag-list"><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/reflection/">reflection</a></li></ul></footer></article><article class="post" data-post-id="cidz0fwvw00be5t0huix99xi2"><header class="post-header container container--narrow"><a href="/2013/warriors-game-more-new-recipes/"><time class="post-date" datetime="2013-10-11T04:00:00.000Z">Fri, 11 Oct 2013</time><h1 class="post-title">Warriors game, more new recipes</h1></a></header><section class="post-content container container--narrow"><p>This past week good. Better than most. I went to the Warriors-Kings preseason game with Paul on Monday night, along with some of his housemates and buddies. Since it was preseason, our seats were pretty decent for what we paid. Today, we went out for pho for Phoebe’s last day. I had some beef noodle soup (on my list of recipes to try). We stopped by 99 Ranch and got some longan to eat for a snack back at the office.</p><p>Cooking highlights:</p><ul><li>I made 40 cloves and a chicken again last Sunday at Jen’s</li><li>Chicken soup from leftover rotisserie chicken</li><li>Strange casserole-esque mixture of tuna, bacon, eggs, broccoli, carrots</li><li>Baked potato (actually microwaved) with tuna salad and scallions</li></ul><p>I was craving canned tuna last week, so I went ahead and bought some cans at Costco. I’m excited to find other ways to repurpose it.

This past weekend, I took her up on her offer.</p><p>We flew in on Saturday and immediately did some exploring—we grabbed lunch from one of Portland’s many food carts, did some window shopping, and visited the <a href="http://portlandartmuseum.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">Portland Art Museum</a> which had a very cool bicycle design exhibit. That night, we ate an excellent dinner at <a href="http://www.pokpokpdx.com/home" target="_blank" rel="external">Pok Pok</a> and then headed downtown to catch a show.</p><p>Sunday, we went to a farmer’s market and cooked lunch before taking the light rail across the Willamette to do some more exploring on foot. That evening, we ate at <a href="http://bokebowl.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Boke Bowl</a>.</p><p>Monday through Wednesday we commuted via light rail to the office. The vibe was friendly and intimate. Nina and I worked in the conference room. Lunch at the food carts during those days; Monday was with Jason, Tuesday was with Dan. On Tuesday night we had dinner in Southwest Portland at <a href="http://www.luclackitchen.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Lúc Lác</a>.</p><p>I’m glad I went; it was an enjoyable trip.
