I got to make some meals for Mom and Jen, such as slow-roasted pork shoulder two ways (one in garlic oil, one in tomato sauce), slow-roasted chicken thighs, frittata, and oxtail stew. And on Christmas, we went over to the Wanningers for dinner (ham, green beans, and salads).</p><p>I got to see some friends, too: Souplantation with Kevin, Tiffany, and Byron; basketball at Gallup with the usual crew; and Josh came over a couple days ago. Yesterday, Akina drove down to visit and we went to the beach and ate Wingstop.

I cooked the two filets two ways, one pan-fried and one roasted with oranges.</p><p>I’ve also been inspired to play guitar in earnest once again. I had a few jam sessions in my room this week. What motivated me? Well, I’ve been listening to the band <a href="http://haimtheband.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">HAIM</a> for the past few weeks. The first time I heard them, I was struck at how different their sound was than everything else that’s out there. The more I listened the more interested I became, in their music and in their story. They are three sisters from L.A. who grew up on music. Their talent, especially that of guitarist Danielle, really impressed me. Sometimes I forget how much I used to love music. And I don’t want to lose that part of my life.</p><p>Yesterday, I went with Jennifer and Brendan to the <a href="http://www.museumca.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">Oakland Museum of California</a>. I learned a lot about the history of California, and much reflection and inspiration came out of the trip. For one, it got me thinking about how future generations will remember us, and how the work I do fits into that context. After all, I want to be remembered and have a hand in changing the course of history for the better. My mind was swimming, and I remained pensive for the rest of the evening. OMCA is on my short list of best museums I’ve visited, even though we only got to see one branch of the museum! There are two others we didn’t get to see, so I’ll definitely want to make another visit.</p><p>Tonight, I had dinner with Nina and Meghana in Berkeley, for the occasion that Meghana’s moving away (to Dubai!). We played it by ear and walked to north side on my recommendation and ended up at <a href="http://www.gregoirerestaurant.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Grégoire</a>. I’m glad we did. It was terrific. Imagine, I had lived right around the corner from the restaurant for three years and had been there only once! I ordered cassoulet with duck confit, salted Iberian pork belly, and sausage. I tend not to eat out as much any more because it saves money and I love to cook, but once in a while is enjoyable. It keeps me inspired culinarily.</p><p>Inspiration, be it music, food, or otherwise, drives me to do what I do. At times it can seem difficult to find, but it’s out there. Just takes a little practice.</p></section><footer class="post-footer container container--narrow"><ul class="post-tag-list"><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/daily/">daily</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/food/">food</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/music/">music</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/reflection/">reflection</a></li></ul></footer></article><article class="post" data-post-id="cik14w9ih00c20vxq8f5pmkwq"><header class="post-header container container--narrow"><a href="/2013/post-thanksgiving/"><time class="post-date" datetime="2013-12-06T05:00:00.000Z">Fri, 6 Dec 2013</time><h1 class="post-title">Post-Thanksgiving</h1></a></header><section class="post-content container container--narrow"><p>I walked to Berkeley Bowl to get groceries earlier this week.

When I got home, I researched what to do while I prepared dinner. By the time I finished eating, I found the crack had spidered up almost towards the top. I called the insurance company and filed a claim. Fortunately, the deductible put me out just a hundred bucks.</p><p>Later that night, I started having a stomachache on top of my headache. I really wasn’t feeling well and was in bed by 9pm.</p><p>The next morning, the insurance company told me that the earliest the mechanic could come replace the windshield was after lunch. This, combined with my stomachache, forced me to just take the day off. I would try to get work done on my lyrics website, but couldn’t concentrate.</p><p>I didn’t have much of an appetite until my stomach eased up in the evening. I made Malaysian chicken curry, and ate a bowl. Later that night, I watched the Warriors’ Curry and others play the Oklahoma City Thunder. It was a truly entertatining game that came down to a last-second game-winning shot by the Warriors. So, the night turned out better than the previous day and a half.</p><p>The day off, albeit spent in physical pain, was a nice change of pace and a break from the monotony of routine. It also put things in perspective: you have to have your downs to have your ups. I deduced, after some research, that the cause of my stomach pain was eating too much broccoli that night. Apparently, since broccoli and similar vegetables are hard for the body to digest, eating too much can <a href="http://www.livestrong.com/article/349377-stomach-cramps-after-eating-broccoli/" target="_blank" rel="external">cause excess intestinal gas</a>.</p><p>Oh, and this weekend, I didn’t even leave the apartment. I continued to make improvements and adding features to my website, <a href="http://llllyrics.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">llllyrics</a>. I did push-ups and watched Thanksgiving-themed <em>Good Eats</em> episodes as breaks.</p></section><footer class="post-footer container container--narrow"><ul class="post-tag-list"><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/daily/">daily</a></li></ul></footer></article><article class="post" data-post-id="cik14w9ip00cf0vxqtu0yfr2d"><header class="post-header container container--narrow"><a href="/2013/podcasts-and-jump-shots/"><time class="post-date" datetime="2013-11-10T05:00:00.000Z">Sun, 10 Nov 2013</time><h1 class="post-title">Podcasts and jump shots</h1></a></header><section class="post-content container container--narrow"><p>I started subscribing to podcasts on my phone and listening to them in the evenings.
