Better than most. I went to the Warriors-Kings preseason game with Paul on Monday night, along with some of his housemates and buddies. Since it was preseason, our seats were pretty decent for what we paid. Today, we went out for pho for Phoebe’s last day. I had some beef noodle soup (on my list of recipes to try). We stopped by 99 Ranch and got some longan to eat for a snack back at the office.</p><p>Cooking highlights:</p><ul><li>I made 40 cloves and a chicken again last Sunday at Jen’s</li><li>Chicken soup from leftover rotisserie chicken</li><li>Strange casserole-esque mixture of tuna, bacon, eggs, broccoli, carrots</li><li>Baked potato (actually microwaved) with tuna salad and scallions</li></ul><p>I was craving canned tuna last week, so I went ahead and bought some cans at Costco. I’m excited to find other ways to repurpose it. In college I often prepared canned tuna for myself, so it was nostalgic to be eating it again.</p></section><footer class="post-footer container container--narrow"><ul class="post-tag-list"><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/daily/">daily</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/food/">food</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/oakland/">oakland</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/point-richmond/">point richmond</a></li></ul></footer></article><article class="post" data-post-id="cidyx4nqc00bhy70h0tjnr6kl"><header class="post-header container container--narrow"><a href="/2013/new-recipes/"><time class="post-date" datetime="2013-10-04T04:00:00.000Z">Fri, 4 Oct 2013</time><h1 class="post-title">New recipes</h1></a></header><section class="post-content container container--narrow"><p>My routine the past couple of weeks has been consisting of working during the day (plus tennis and basketball once a week each), then cooking and working on my typeface in the evenings and weekends.</p><p>Meal highlights:</p><ul><li>Pulled pork</li><li>Malaysian chicken curry</li><li>40 cloves and a chicken</li></ul></section><footer class="post-footer container container--narrow"><ul class="post-tag-list"><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/daily/">daily</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/food/">food</a></li></ul></footer></article><article class="post" data-post-id="cidyx4nqe00bky70hjwjkwwmz"><header class="post-header container container--narrow"><a href="/2013/moon-festival/"><time class="post-date" datetime="2013-09-22T04:00:00.000Z">Sun, 22 Sep 2013</time><h1 class="post-title">Moon Festival</h1></a></header><section class="post-content container container--narrow"><p>Summary from the past week and a half:</p><ul><li>I went to the A’s game on Monday night.

That night, we ate an excellent dinner at <a href="http://www.pokpokpdx.com/home" target="_blank" rel="external">Pok Pok</a> and then headed downtown to catch a show.</p><p>Sunday, we went to a farmer’s market and cooked lunch before taking the light rail across the Willamette to do some more exploring on foot. That evening, we ate at <a href="http://bokebowl.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Boke Bowl</a>.</p><p>Monday through Wednesday we commuted via light rail to the office. The vibe was friendly and intimate. Nina and I worked in the conference room. Lunch at the food carts during those days; Monday was with Jason, Tuesday was with Dan. On Tuesday night we had dinner in Southwest Portland at <a href="http://www.luclackitchen.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Lúc Lác</a>.</p><p>I’m glad I went; it was an enjoyable trip.
