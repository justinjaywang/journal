When I got home, I researched what to do while I prepared dinner. By the time I finished eating, I found the crack had spidered up almost towards the top. I called the insurance company and filed a claim. Fortunately, the deductible put me out just a hundred bucks.</p><p>Later that night, I started having a stomachache on top of my headache. I really wasn’t feeling well and was in bed by 9pm.</p><p>The next morning, the insurance company told me that the earliest the mechanic could come replace the windshield was after lunch. This, combined with my stomachache, forced me to just take the day off. I would try to get work done on my lyrics website, but couldn’t concentrate.</p><p>I didn’t have much of an appetite until my stomach eased up in the evening. I made Malaysian chicken curry, and ate a bowl. Later that night, I watched the Warriors’ Curry and others play the Oklahoma City Thunder. It was a truly entertatining game that came down to a last-second game-winning shot by the Warriors. So, the night turned out better than the previous day and a half.</p><p>The day off, albeit spent in physical pain, was a nice change of pace and a break from the monotony of routine. It also put things in perspective: you have to have your downs to have your ups. I deduced, after some research, that the cause of my stomach pain was eating too much broccoli that night. Apparently, since broccoli and similar vegetables are hard for the body to digest, eating too much can <a href="http://www.livestrong.com/article/349377-stomach-cramps-after-eating-broccoli/" target="_blank" rel="external">cause excess intestinal gas</a>.</p><p>Oh, and this weekend, I didn’t even leave the apartment. I continued to make improvements and adding features to my website, <a href="http://llllyrics.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">llllyrics</a>. I did push-ups and watched Thanksgiving-themed <em>Good Eats</em> episodes as breaks.</p></section><footer class="post-footer container container--narrow"><ul class="post-tag-list"><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/daily/">daily</a></li></ul></footer></article><article class="post" data-post-id="cigukoqkf00boa00hu9jwcc1q"><header class="post-header container container--narrow"><a href="/2013/podcasts-and-jump-shots/"><time class="post-date" datetime="2013-11-10T05:00:00.000Z">Sun, 10 Nov 2013</time><h1 class="post-title">Podcasts and jump shots</h1></a></header><section class="post-content container container--narrow"><p>I started subscribing to podcasts on my phone and listening to them in the evenings.

Better than most. I went to the Warriors-Kings preseason game with Paul on Monday night, along with some of his housemates and buddies. Since it was preseason, our seats were pretty decent for what we paid. Today, we went out for pho for Phoebe’s last day. I had some beef noodle soup (on my list of recipes to try).

Fridays nights are sacred; they’re Justin time. No offense, but I feel like I could be doing something more productive. This trend dates back to my college days, when I almost always regretted going to parties and would have rather have spent the time improving my skills, such as playing guitar. I think I’m just different in this way.</p><p>I love nights where I’m feeling inspired and my mind is swimming. Tonight is one of those nights. It started with the question “Who do I want to be in five years?” and the realization that I need to be more disciplined to achieve my vision. I can’t lose sight of who I am and who I want to be. So I sent an email to myself, 5 years in <a href="http://www.futureme.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">the future</a> as a checkpoint.</p><p>I also came across ideas for <a href="http://www.stumbleupon.com/su/1GDCAp/:1uZG5T2Sq:qTeKzgqt/www.highexistence.com/30-challenges-for-30-days/" target="_blank" rel="external">challenges</a> that was inspired by Matt Cutt’s <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/matt_cutts_try_something_new_for_30_days.html" target="_blank" rel="external">TED talk</a> about trying something new for 30 days.</p><p>If there’s something I’d like to change about myself or I just want to form a good habit, nothing’s stopping me. So I might as well do it as soon as possible. These are the challenges I chose:</p><ul><li>Take a walk each day. I can easily accomplish this by walking into town on work days, or in the evenings to Trader Joe’s.</li><li>Take a cold shower each day. Or when I do take a shower, make it a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shower#Scottish_shower" target="_blank" rel="external">Scottish shower</a>. Acccording to many sources they have real <a href="http://www.artofmanliness.com/2010/01/18/the-james-bond-shower-a-shot-of-cold-water-for-health-and-vitality/" target="_blank" rel="external">health benefits</a>.</li><li>Keep a dream journal. I’ve been dreaming a lot lately. I briefly flirted with writing my dreams a couple years ago, but didn’t keep it up.</li><li>100 push ups each day. I’ve already been doing this for the last two weeks.</li><li>Be honest, to myself and to others.</li></ul><p>These can start off as 30 day challenges, but can easily become lifelong habits.</p></section><footer class="post-footer container container--narrow"><ul class="post-tag-list"><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/reflection/">reflection</a></li></ul></footer></article><article class="post" data-post-id="cigukoqku00cda00hgo6qcm32"><header class="post-header container container--narrow"><a href="/2013/new-recipes/"><time class="post-date" datetime="2013-10-04T04:00:00.000Z">Fri, 4 Oct 2013</time><h1 class="post-title">New recipes</h1></a></header><section class="post-content container container--narrow"><p>My routine the past couple of weeks has been consisting of working during the day (plus tennis and basketball once a week each), then cooking and working on my typeface in the evenings and weekends.</p><p>Meal highlights:</p><ul><li>Pulled pork</li><li>Malaysian chicken curry</li><li>40 cloves and a chicken</li></ul></section><footer class="post-footer container container--narrow"><ul class="post-tag-list"><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/daily/">daily</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/food/">food</a></li></ul></footer></article><article class="post" data-post-id="cigukoqkw00cga00h7w8lpckq"><header class="post-header container container--narrow"><a href="/2013/moon-festival/"><time class="post-date" datetime="2013-09-22T04:00:00.000Z">Sun, 22 Sep 2013</time><h1 class="post-title">Moon Festival</h1></a></header><section class="post-content container container--narrow"><p>Summary from the past week and a half:</p><ul><li>I went to the A’s game on Monday night.
