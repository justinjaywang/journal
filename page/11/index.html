Fridays nights are sacred; they’re Justin time. No offense, but I feel like I could be doing something more productive. This trend dates back to my college days, when I almost always regretted going to parties and would have rather have spent the time improving my skills, such as playing guitar. I think I’m just different in this way.</p><p>I love nights where I’m feeling inspired and my mind is swimming. Tonight is one of those nights. It started with the question “Who do I want to be in five years?” and the realization that I need to be more disciplined to achieve my vision. I can’t lose sight of who I am and who I want to be. So I sent an email to myself, 5 years in <a href="http://www.futureme.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">the future</a> as a checkpoint.</p><p>I also came across ideas for <a href="http://www.stumbleupon.com/su/1GDCAp/:1uZG5T2Sq:qTeKzgqt/www.highexistence.com/30-challenges-for-30-days/" target="_blank" rel="external">challenges</a> that was inspired by Matt Cutt’s <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/matt_cutts_try_something_new_for_30_days.html" target="_blank" rel="external">TED talk</a> about trying something new for 30 days.</p><p>If there’s something I’d like to change about myself or I just want to form a good habit, nothing’s stopping me. So I might as well do it as soon as possible. These are the challenges I chose:</p><ul><li>Take a walk each day. I can easily accomplish this by walking into town on work days, or in the evenings to Trader Joe’s.</li><li>Take a cold shower each day. Or when I do take a shower, make it a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shower#Scottish_shower" target="_blank" rel="external">Scottish shower</a>. Acccording to many sources they have real <a href="http://www.artofmanliness.com/2010/01/18/the-james-bond-shower-a-shot-of-cold-water-for-health-and-vitality/" target="_blank" rel="external">health benefits</a>.</li><li>Keep a dream journal. I’ve been dreaming a lot lately. I briefly flirted with writing my dreams a couple years ago, but didn’t keep it up.</li><li>100 push ups each day. I’ve already been doing this for the last two weeks.</li><li>Be honest, to myself and to others.</li></ul><p>These can start off as 30 day challenges, but can easily become lifelong habits.</p></section><footer class="post-footer container container--narrow"><ul class="post-tag-list"><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/reflection/">reflection</a></li></ul></footer></article><article class="post" data-post-id="cij94vgli00cvu50h01kn9p1j"><header class="post-header container container--narrow"><a href="/2013/new-recipes/"><time class="post-date" datetime="2013-10-04T04:00:00.000Z">Fri, 4 Oct 2013</time><h1 class="post-title">New recipes</h1></a></header><section class="post-content container container--narrow"><p>My routine the past couple of weeks has been consisting of working during the day (plus tennis and basketball once a week each), then cooking and working on my typeface in the evenings and weekends.</p><p>Meal highlights:</p><ul><li>Pulled pork</li><li>Malaysian chicken curry</li><li>40 cloves and a chicken</li></ul></section><footer class="post-footer container container--narrow"><ul class="post-tag-list"><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/daily/">daily</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/food/">food</a></li></ul></footer></article><article class="post" data-post-id="cij94vglm00cyu50h1po4igcc"><header class="post-header container container--narrow"><a href="/2013/moon-festival/"><time class="post-date" datetime="2013-09-22T04:00:00.000Z">Sun, 22 Sep 2013</time><h1 class="post-title">Moon Festival</h1></a></header><section class="post-content container container--narrow"><p>Summary from the past week and a half:</p><ul><li>I went to the A’s game on Monday night.

This past weekend, I took her up on her offer.</p><p>We flew in on Saturday and immediately did some exploring—we grabbed lunch from one of Portland’s many food carts, did some window shopping, and visited the <a href="http://portlandartmuseum.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">Portland Art Museum</a> which had a very cool bicycle design exhibit. That night, we ate an excellent dinner at <a href="http://www.pokpokpdx.com/home" target="_blank" rel="external">Pok Pok</a> and then headed downtown to catch a show.</p><p>Sunday, we went to a farmer’s market and cooked lunch before taking the light rail across the Willamette to do some more exploring on foot. That evening, we ate at <a href="http://bokebowl.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Boke Bowl</a>.</p><p>Monday through Wednesday we commuted via light rail to the office. The vibe was friendly and intimate. Nina and I worked in the conference room. Lunch at the food carts during those days; Monday was with Jason, Tuesday was with Dan. On Tuesday night we had dinner in Southwest Portland at <a href="http://www.luclackitchen.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Lúc Lác</a>.</p><p>I’m glad I went; it was an enjoyable trip. Portland is pleasant and a little offbeat, though I couldn’t help thinking it’s not much more than that.</p></section><footer class="post-footer container container--narrow"><ul class="post-tag-list"><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/food/">food</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/portland/">portland</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/vacation/">vacation</a></li></ul></footer></article><article class="post" data-post-id="cij94vglv00d6u50h2n01ojma"><header class="post-header container container--narrow"><a href="/2013/hoops-at-live-oak/"><time class="post-date" datetime="2013-08-25T04:00:00.000Z">Sun, 25 Aug 2013</time><h1 class="post-title">Hoops at Live Oak</h1></a></header><section class="post-content container container--narrow"><p>The work week was fine.
