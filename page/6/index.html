After basketball on Thursday evening, I invited Jen and Brendan over for dinner. I made lu rou fan with fried tofu, preserved turnip omelette, and cabbage.</p><p>Lately, I’ve been cooking a lot with freezer and pantry ingredients so I can use them up before I move back to SoCal. Just like in <em>Chopped</em>, the constraints with which I had to work forced me to be creative with what dishes I made. My favorites were (1) tuna fried rice with a frozen vegetable mix of green beans, corn, peas, and carrots and (2) an anchovy and chive tomato sauce that I ate over rice.</p></section><footer class="post-footer container container--narrow"><ul class="post-tag-list"><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/daily/">daily</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/food/">food</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/marin/">marin</a></li></ul></footer></article><article class="post" data-post-id="ciudizuls006p366v843yoe7i"><header class="post-header container container--narrow"><a href="/2014/week-two/"><time class="post-date" datetime="2014-10-11T04:00:00.000Z">Sat, 11 Oct 2014</time><h1 class="post-title">Week two</h1></a></header><section class="post-content container container--narrow"><p>I’ve been as productive as ever during this, my second week of unemployment.</p><p>My routine has been to wake up early, do push-ups while I microwave oatmeal, eat the oatmeal, and start working.

Already I can feel that the pace of my life has picked up, and that’s a good thing.</p><p>My first move was to pursue this startup idea with Brian, and begin recruiting people to join. On Sunday, I met with Edmund for brunch at <a href="http://www.suppenkuche.com/welcome.html" target="_blank" rel="external">Suppenküche</a>. More lunches and dinners with friends throughout the week to chat: Monday night, sushi with Brandon; Tuesday night, Vietnamese food with the BI alums; Wednesday, lunch with Edmund (phở) and then dinner with Pavel (Z &amp; Y Chinese). As such, I had crashed at Brian’s Tuesday night and then spent Wednesday in the city working at a café and at the Metreon.</p><p>Saturday, I stopped by the Hardly Strictly Bluegrass Festival at Golden Gate Park with Cole and Felicia. They drove, and I provided the sandwiches from Togo’s. That night, I went over to Jen’s for dinner while we watched the baseball playoffs.</p><p>Working on this idea full-time during the week gave me a glimpse of what it’d be like long-term. I could see fairly quickly it wasn’t going to work out. The moments of severe doubt outweighed the moments of inspiration. The biggest questions I had were (1) is this the right team? (2) is this product something that people want? I’d be lying to myself if I said yes. I knew in my heart it wasn’t the right opportunity. I met with Brian to tell him on Sunday night.</p></section><footer class="post-footer container container--narrow"><ul class="post-tag-list"><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/concerts/">concerts</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/daily/">daily</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/food/">food</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/reflection/">reflection</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/san-francisco/">san francisco</a></li></ul></footer></article><article class="post" data-post-id="ciudizum60073366vtmlehlbp"><header class="post-header container container--narrow"><a href="/2014/post-vacation/"><time class="post-date" datetime="2014-09-27T04:00:00.000Z">Sat, 27 Sep 2014</time><h1 class="post-title">Post-vacation</h1></a></header><section class="post-content container container--narrow"><p><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/4291520/journal-images/richmond-marina-bay.jpg" alt="View from the top of the hill I&#39;d often run up in Point Richmond."></p><p>I had jet lag for several days once I got back.

We had to find our own way this time, which made for a richer experience. We interacted more with locals. Our Chinese improved by virtue of having to communicate with others and needing to recognize characters in place names and menu items.</li><li>My newfound running hobby let me explore Taiwan’s landscape on my own in the early mornings. I ran at the local elementary school track in Yizhu, in Taipei on the streets of the Shilin and Neihu districts, and up Elephant Mountain to catch the sunrise over Taipei 101. The only other people that were up at that hour were old folks who were also exercising. They greeted me good morning in Taiwanese and I greeted them back and I felt like I had been inducted into their secret club. I love the feeling of being awake while everyone else is still sleeping.</li><li>Where you live matters. And you can choose where you live. So why not love where you live? I can pretty easily pack my belongings (which aren’t really that much), move to another city, find a job, make friends, and start a new life. Taipei is a particularly great city. The cost of living (food, housing, transportation) is relatively low. And its urban planning and design is impressive—public transportation is efficient and accessible; public spaces, like parks and basketball courts, are abundant; facilities are well-maintained. We took advantage of the popular city bike share program, YouBike, to zip from place to place as well as take in the sights.</li><li>Everywhere we went, people (be it family, family friends, or friends of family friends) went out of their way to make us feel comfortable. I even felt undeserving of such generosity. They picked us up. They drove us places. They let us stay at their homes. And when we left, they suggested we stay longer. And, of course, they offered us food. So much food. It was all very much appreciated and I can’t thank them enough. I won’t hesitate to offer the same level of hospitality to anyone that visits me in the future.</li><li>Food was the overarching theme of the trip. My most memorable experiences and interactions have revolved around it, from local breakfast shops, self-serve buffets, and night markets to elaborate lunches and dinners with family and friends. It was all so delicious and inspiring. I will be cooking only Taiwanese food for the next few months.</li></ol></section><footer class="post-footer container container--narrow"><ul class="post-tag-list"><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/reflection/">reflection</a></li></ul></footer></article><article class="post" data-post-id="ciudizuml007e366v3krofi6i"><header class="post-header container container--narrow"><a href="/2014/taiwan-pt-3/"><time class="post-date" datetime="2014-09-13T04:00:00.000Z">Sat, 13 Sep 2014</time><h1 class="post-title">Taiwan, pt. 3</h1></a></header><section class="post-content container container--narrow"><p>We stayed at a hostel near Taipei 101 for the remainder of the trip.</p><ul><li>Pai gu fan at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/GrandHyattpaigu" target="_blank" rel="external">君悅排骨</a> (twice); it was among the best meals of the trip.</li><li>Jen took us to the Google Taipei office on the 73rd floor of Taipei 101 for lunch with a view.</li><li>Climbing Elephant Mountain with Brendan and Jen in the evening.
