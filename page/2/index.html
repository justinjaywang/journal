I met Dad in Berkeley first, then we stopped for some Vietnamese bún before BARTing to the city to find him a suit for the wedding.</p><p>The next morning, we walked over to Hotel Durant. When Jen and Brendan arrived, I helped unload stuff and then made a Costco run with Brendan, his dad, and Mike. For lunch, I had dry-fried green beans over rice at the Asian Ghetto. In the evening, we had rehearsal at the stadium and then dinner with family and friends at Angeline’s.</p><p>Saturday was filled with helping for the wedding, pictures for the wedding, the wedding itself, and more helping for the wedding. I ate leftover jambalaya from Angeline’s in the morning, then leftover baby back ribs for lunch. The venue was beautiful, the ceremony and reception went smoothly, and everyone seemed to have a good time.</p><p>I saw Jason early the next morning; we drove to a diner on 4th Street for breakfast and then chatted for a bit afterwards. Back at the hotel, I helped load up the remaining items as people checked out and went their separate ways. After lunch at Long Life Vegi house in downtown Berkeley with Mom and Dad, I traveled with Mom down to Jen’s place in San Jose. We ate at a Taiwanese restaurant for dinner, then dropped Mom off at the airport. I stayed over at Jen and Brendan’s that night. We hung out, just like old times, and I met the newest member of the family, their dog Zucchi.</p><p>The next day, the three of us drove to Berkeley to meet Dad for lunch at Turkish Kitchen. I walked with Dad around campus in the afternoon; in the evening, I had bún again with Dad and then headed to the airport.</p></section><footer class="post-footer container container--narrow"><ul class="post-tag-list"><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/berkeley/">berkeley</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/family/">family</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/food/">food</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/vacation/">vacation</a></li></ul></footer></article><article class="post" data-post-id="cimb8b3y900260p9iat6f5d00"><header class="post-header container container--narrow"><a href="/2015/new-and-old-friends/"><time class="post-date" datetime="2015-09-24T16:48:49.000Z">Thu, 24 Sep 2015</time><h1 class="post-title">New and old friends</h1></a></header><section class="post-content container container--narrow"><ul><li>drinks in the East Village for Anouck’s birthday</li><li>hoops on Saturday morning in Brooklyn</li><li>more furniture assemply and hanging out with the girls in Apt. 6B</li><li>hoops after work on Wednesday with Chris Rawles at Riverside Park</li><li>lunch talk by typographer Bruno Maag in Gowanus with Skylar from Oak</li><li>Whitney Museum on Friday night with Carolyn</li><li>hoops on Saturday morning in Brooklyn</li><li>late night beers with Carolina</li><li>Sunday afternoon out with Carolina and Amy</li><li>suit shopping for Jen’s wedding; I ended up buying one in ultra skinny fit from Topman</li><li>hoops and dinner at Han Dynasty with Chris</li></ul></section><footer class="post-footer container container--narrow"><ul class="post-tag-list"><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/daily/">daily</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/food/">food</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/new-york/">new york</a></li></ul></footer></article><article class="post" data-post-id="cimb8b3ye002a0p9iv37844hx"><header class="post-header container container--narrow"><a href="/2015/labor-day/"><time class="post-date" datetime="2015-09-11T01:16:21.000Z">Thu, 10 Sep 2015</time><h1 class="post-title">Labor Day</h1></a></header><section class="post-content container container--narrow"><p>The past week was extremely busy, but fun. The project I’d been working for the last month and a half shipped on Tuesday, so I was focused on getting everything done in time. I put in extra hours in the mornings and evenings working from home, and a good chunk of the long weekend was spent in front of my laptop. I didn’t mind at all, though, since it’s work I like to do. It was exhilarating. I hadn’t felt that way since back in school.</p><p>I’m proud of the end result. We all became experts in a framework and language that were completely new to us at the start. I learned a lot of lessons on this project, too—don’t take shortcuts (they always catch up to you), don’t settle for a hack, and be patient and deliberate.</p><p>On top of this, I moved apartments in the middle of the week. What little time I had not working was spent getting set up and settled into my new place. Funny story, actually:</p><p>I met my new roommates Monday night to get the keys, and my new roommate Justin helped me move the couch from my old apartment. Afterwards, I went for a walk around the complex and ended up helping two other people move in in separate instances (I was already sweaty, so it was fine). The first person I helped because the mover offered me 20 bucks help him carry large furniture. I was about to head home after that when I passed by another person with a bunch of luggage who looked lost, so I offered to help. When she was able to track down her roommates, they came down and we all helped carry her stuff up to the apartment.</p><p>I didn’t have time to get groceries and cook, so I ate out for lunch during the latter half of the week after I moved. I had cold-skin noodles, bánh mì ga, and a Cambodian coconut shrimp sandwich.</p><p>I played basketball in Brooklyn again on Saturday—it’s something I look forward to every week. Later that night, the girl who I helped move earlier in the week and her roommates invited me over for dinner. I stopped by again on Sunday and Monday (Labor Day) to help them build IKEA furniture, and they treated me to dinner on Monday night.</p><p>Sunday, I finally saw Michael again, for Tibetan noodles in Jackson Heights, Queens. Monday morning, I walked to Chinatown for groceries and cooked a pot of lu rou for lunch.</p></section><footer class="post-footer container container--narrow"><ul class="post-tag-list"><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/daily/">daily</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/food/">food</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/labor-day/">labor day</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/new-york/">new york</a></li></ul></footer></article><article class="post" data-post-id="cimb8b3yh002g0p9ih9dexyrb"><header class="post-header container container--narrow"><a href="/2015/thoughts-from-new-york/"><time class="post-date" datetime="2015-08-30T21:15:42.000Z">Sun, 30 Aug 2015</time><h1 class="post-title">Thoughts from New York</h1></a></header><section class="post-content container container--narrow"><p>The diversity of New York was one of the first things that struck me. It feels like the capital of the world, in a way. You can meet people from anywhere here. As an Asian American, I never felt like I didn’t belong.</p><p>I absolutely love the walkability. It’s been my favorite part, hands down. As a means of transport, as a form of exercise, and as an activity in and of itself. There’s no better way to get a feel for the city. You can walk at all hours, too, without feeling weird like you would if you were to do it back home.</p><p>I’ve been pleasantly surprised by the wealth of public spaces and parks. Public transportation has been great, too. That being said, it still doesn’t compare to Taipei in either of these regards.</p><p>My least favorite part has been the mosquitos and the muggy weather. I get bit every time I play basketball in Brooklyn. No comparison to Taipei here, either.</p><p>The sheer urban-ness has made me crave space, quiet, and nature. Crowded streets, ambulance sirens at all hours, and hot piles of trash will do that to you.</p><p>A lot of the people living here seem to be only temporary—young professionals who work hard for a handful of years, burn out, and then move to the suburbs. Or Cleveland. Living in New York is almost like a rite of passage.</p><p><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/4291520/journal-images/new-york-chinatown.jpg" alt="Manhattan&#39;s Chinatown."><br><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/4291520/journal-images/new-york-tompkins.jpg" alt="Tompkins Square Park in the East Village."><br><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/4291520/journal-images/new-york-east-river.jpg" alt="View of the East River from the Upper East Side."></p></section><footer class="post-footer container container--narrow"><ul class="post-tag-list"><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/new-york/">new york</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/reflection/">reflection</a></li></ul></footer></article><article class="post" data-post-id="cimb8b3yl002j0p9ig7ocm8z8"><header class="post-header container container--narrow"><a href="/2015/new-york-pt-3/"><time class="post-date" datetime="2015-08-30T21:15:32.000Z">Sun, 30 Aug 2015</time><h1 class="post-title">New York, pt. 3</h1></a></header><section class="post-content container container--narrow"><ul><li>work</li><li>cooking</li><li>picnic in Central Park with Anouck</li><li>basketball in Brooklyn with Justin B.</li><li>walks along the East River and in the neighborhood</li><li>listening to Simon &amp; Garfunkel</li><li>watching <em>Hey Arnold!</em> and <em>30 Rock</em> (notice a theme?)</li><li>found a new place for next month, in the same apartment complex</li></ul></section><footer class="post-footer container container--narrow"><ul class="post-tag-list"><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/daily/">daily</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/new-york/">new york</a></li></ul></footer></article><article class="post" data-post-id="cimb8b3yn002m0p9ikbiw8wg4"><header class="post-header container container--narrow"><a href="/2015/new-york-pt-2/"><time class="post-date" datetime="2015-08-16T10:09:19.000Z">Sun, 16 Aug 2015</time><h1 class="post-title">New York, pt. 2</h1></a></header><section class="post-content container container--narrow"><p>New York has so many options for eating out, and from every type of cuisine. I’ve already had Middle Eastern, Mediterranean, Caribbean, Mexican, Peruvian, Chinese, Taiwanese, Japanese, Vietnamese, Cambodian, Thai, and American. Still, I was glad to start cooking again when I found an apartment to sublet in the East Village.</p><p>I walked to Chinatown last weekend to shop for groceries and get some kitchen supplies. I made <em>lu rou</em> with fried tofu, along with Taiwanese cabbage, kale, carrots, and sunny side up eggs; I packed the leftovers in a rice bowl as lunch for the past week. The coming week’s menu includes tomato eggs, julienned carrots, Taiwanese cabbage, braised king oyster mushrooms, and pickled mustard greens.</p><p>I’ve settled into my sublet now, too. I really love the apartment complex. It’s got plenty of walking space, trees, lawns, and basketball courts. I go for walks in the evenings, when it’s nice and cool. I’ve shot hoops a few times here and played pickup once, though I’ve still been heading to Brooklyn to play on Saturday mornings.</p></section><footer class="post-footer container container--narrow"><ul class="post-tag-list"><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/daily/">daily</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/food/">food</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/new-york/">new york</a></li></ul></footer></article><article class="post" data-post-id="cimb8b3yo002q0p9igfp2hw6e"><header class="post-header container container--narrow"><a href="/2015/new-york-pt-1/"><time class="post-date" datetime="2015-08-07T04:08:54.000Z">Fri, 7 Aug 2015</time><h1 class="post-title">New York, pt. 1</h1></a></header><section class="post-content container container--narrow"><p>The first couple of weeks have been a whirlwind. I flew in the night of the 19th and started work the next morning. My flight was delayed too, so I ended up having to take a cab just to arrive at Michael and Parilee’s apartment before 11pm. I remember being so tired and sleep-deprived those first few days, yet I had to figure everything out on the go. It was a bit of a culture shock at first, but I’ve adjusted.</p><p>The internship has been good, overall. The guys are super laid back, and I have a ton of freedom. Plus, they all have great taste and work on useful projects. The office is in Union Square, so there’s a ton of lunch options nearby (<a href="http://taboonette.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Taboonette</a> and <a href="http://numpangnyc.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Num Pang</a> are right around the corner).</p><p>While staying at Michael and Parilee’s, I’d take the subway to work in the mornings; in the evenings, I occasionally opted to walk home. It’s a long walk (about an hour and a half to the Upper East Side), but there’s no better way to see the city. Along the way, I passed by places like Rockefeller Center, the Empire State Building, and Times Square. Sometimes I’d stop in Central Park, eat a light dinner that I packed, and people-watch. On my first day off on Saturday, I explored Chinatown in the morning and got <em>ji tui fan</em> for lunch.</p><p>I’ve seen some friends while I’ve been here, too. Akina introduced me to <a href="http://xianfoods.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Xi’an Famous Foods</a>, and I’ve already been back to eat there multiple times (their cold-skin noodles have been the best thing I’ve eaten here so far). Laura was in town, too. I hung out with her in Brooklyn on Saturday; we saw the Brooklyn Museum with Kelly, strolled through Prospect Park with Dmitry, and then had dinner and drinks. I also had dinner the following week (soba in SoHo) with Carolyn, who I also knew from school.</p><p>This past Saturday, I played basketball in the morning with Dmitry in Crown Heights. I moved into my sublet in the East Village later that afternoon. I crammed into a crowded subway car and then labored down 14th Street carrying my stuff. The place was a mess when I arrived, but I’ve been slowly cleaning and making it feel like a home, somewhat. That night, I returned to Brooklyn for Dmitry’s house party, and I saw even more people from Berkeley, like McKenna and Isi.</p></section><footer class="post-footer container container--narrow"><ul class="post-tag-list"><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/daily/">daily</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/food/">food</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/new-york/">new york</a></li></ul></footer></article><article class="post" data-post-id="cimb8b3yr002u0p9imp2wogmx"><header class="post-header container container--narrow"><a href="/2015/pre-new-york/"><time class="post-date" datetime="2015-07-23T00:54:17.000Z">Wed, 22 Jul 2015</time><h1 class="post-title">Pre-New York</h1></a></header><section class="post-content container container--narrow"><ul><li>ordered a new MacBook Pro to replace my old one of five years, which had gotten way too slow; took a few days to get the new one set up just how I like it</li><li>got new all-black Vans; they’ll be my New York shoes</li><li>SW Seafood in Irvine with Mom, Uncle Ray, Aunt Jenny, Alex, and Wei; it was a going-away dinner, of sorts, for me and Alex, who’s going to New Orleans next month for school</li><li>bought and installed a new printer for Mom</li><li>Souplantation for dinner with Josh, Joyce, Randy, Youmi, and Leah; drinks and hanging out at Youmi’s afterwards</li><li>laundry, packing, and apartment hunting</li></ul></section><footer class="post-footer container container--narrow"><ul class="post-tag-list"><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/daily/">daily</a></li></ul></footer></article><article class="post" data-post-id="cimb8b3yw002w0p9iraulkkdl"><header class="post-header container container--narrow"><a href="/2015/july-4th/"><time class="post-date" datetime="2015-07-18T18:46:02.000Z">Sat, 18 Jul 2015</time><h1 class="post-title">July 4th</h1></a></header><section class="post-content container container--narrow"><p>In early July, I’d still been going to design and developer meetups pretty regularly.

I was supposed to take her to a Japanese restaurant (she’s from Japan), but it was closed for the holiday so we ate at a Taiwanese place nearby. In the evening, I met up with Randy, Brian, and Nasir for hot pot at Little Sheep, firework-watching at El Conejo Park, and then some beers at Randy’s.</p><p>Josh, Joyce, and I took a day trip to LA on the 5th to see a house concert for classical music. When we got back home, we had Souplantation for dinner with Kristina and her friend Tina.</p><p>The next couple of days, Josh and I hung out and played music together. We saw Youmi in the park on the 6th, and made dinner plans on the 7th, and invited her friend Leah, Randy, and Brian. We had a nice dinner at a Cuban restaurant at the Lab in Costa Mesa.</p><p>I drove up to Venice on the 9th to visit an old friend from Berkeley, Bez; he’s been working at a startup on Abbot Kinney, so we had a chat and he showed me around.</p><p>On the 11th, Brian stopped by in the late afternoon to play around with Josh’s drum machine. Randy and Tiffany came over after dinner; the three of us took a stroll in the park around sunset and then listened to music afterwards.</p><p>During this time, I had also been talking with <a href="http://oak.is" target="_blank" rel="external">Oak</a>, a design studio in New York. I’d been following their work for a some time, and by chance I emailed them late last month when I saw they had an internship opening.
