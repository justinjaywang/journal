It feels like the capital of the world, in a way. You can meet people from anywhere here. As an Asian American, I never felt like I didn’t belong.</p><p>I absolutely love the walkability. It’s been my favorite part, hands down. As a means of transport, as a form of exercise, and as an activity in and of itself. There’s no better way to get a feel for the city. You can walk at all hours, too, without feeling weird like you would if you were to do it back home.</p><p>I’ve been pleasantly surprised by the wealth of public spaces and parks. Public transportation has been great, too. That being said, it still doesn’t compare to Taipei in either of these regards.</p><p>My least favorite part has been the mosquitos and the muggy weather. I get bit every time I play basketball in Brooklyn. No comparison to Taipei here, either.</p><p>The sheer urban-ness has made me crave space, quiet, and nature. Crowded streets, ambulance sirens at all hours, and hot piles of trash will do that to you.</p><p>A lot of the people living here seem to be only temporary—young professionals who work hard for a handful of years, burn out, and then move to the suburbs. Or Cleveland. Living in New York is almost like a rite of passage.</p><p><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/4291520/journal-images/new-york-chinatown.jpg" alt="Manhattan&#39;s Chinatown."><br><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/4291520/journal-images/new-york-tompkins.jpg" alt="Tompkins Square Park in the East Village."><br><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/4291520/journal-images/new-york-east-river.jpg" alt="View of the East River from the Upper East Side."></p></section><footer class="post-footer container container--narrow"><ul class="post-tag-list"><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/new-york/">new york</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/reflection/">reflection</a></li></ul></footer></article><article class="post" data-post-id="cik1p1aaa001vdlxqdbxnzecx"><header class="post-header container container--narrow"><a href="/2015/new-york-pt-3/"><time class="post-date" datetime="2015-08-30T21:15:32.000Z">Sun, 30 Aug 2015</time><h1 class="post-title">New York, pt. 3</h1></a></header><section class="post-content container container--narrow"><ul><li>work</li><li>cooking</li><li>picnic in Central Park with Anouck</li><li>basketball in Brooklyn with Justin B.</li><li>walks along the East River and in the neighborhood</li><li>listening to Simon &amp; Garfunkel</li><li>watching <em>Hey Arnold!</em> and <em>30 Rock</em> (notice a theme?)</li><li>found a new place for next month, in the same apartment complex</li></ul></section><footer class="post-footer container container--narrow"><ul class="post-tag-list"><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/daily/">daily</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/new-york/">new york</a></li></ul></footer></article><article class="post" data-post-id="cik1p1aaf001ydlxq2nkvs3zl"><header class="post-header container container--narrow"><a href="/2015/new-york-pt-2/"><time class="post-date" datetime="2015-08-16T10:09:19.000Z">Sun, 16 Aug 2015</time><h1 class="post-title">New York, pt. 2</h1></a></header><section class="post-content container container--narrow"><p>New York has so many options for eating out, and from every type of cuisine. I’ve already had Middle Eastern, Mediterranean, Caribbean, Mexican, Peruvian, Chinese, Taiwanese, Japanese, Vietnamese, Cambodian, Thai, and American. Still, I was glad to start cooking again when I found an apartment to sublet in the East Village.</p><p>I walked to Chinatown last weekend to shop for groceries and get some kitchen supplies. I made <em>lu rou</em> with fried tofu, along with Taiwanese cabbage, kale, carrots, and sunny side up eggs; I packed the leftovers in a rice bowl as lunch for the past week. The coming week’s menu includes tomato eggs, julienned carrots, Taiwanese cabbage, braised king oyster mushrooms, and pickled mustard greens.</p><p>I’ve settled into my sublet now, too. I really love the apartment complex. It’s got plenty of walking space, trees, lawns, and basketball courts. I go for walks in the evenings, when it’s nice and cool. I’ve shot hoops a few times here and played pickup once, though I’ve still been heading to Brooklyn to play on Saturday mornings.</p></section><footer class="post-footer container container--narrow"><ul class="post-tag-list"><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/daily/">daily</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/food/">food</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/new-york/">new york</a></li></ul></footer></article><article class="post" data-post-id="cik1p1aam0022dlxq6tymvf71"><header class="post-header container container--narrow"><a href="/2015/new-york-pt-1/"><time class="post-date" datetime="2015-08-07T04:08:54.000Z">Fri, 7 Aug 2015</time><h1 class="post-title">New York, pt. 1</h1></a></header><section class="post-content container container--narrow"><p>The first couple of weeks have been a whirlwind. I flew in the night of the 19th and started work the next morning. My flight was delayed too, so I ended up having to take a cab just to arrive at Michael and Parilee’s apartment before 11pm. I remember being so tired and sleep-deprived those first few days, yet I had to figure everything out on the go. It was a bit of a culture shock at first, but I’ve adjusted.</p><p>The internship has been good, overall. The guys are super laid back, and I have a ton of freedom. Plus, they all have great taste and work on useful projects. The office is in Union Square, so there’s a ton of lunch options nearby (<a href="http://taboonette.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Taboonette</a> and <a href="http://numpangnyc.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Num Pang</a> are right around the corner).</p><p>While staying at Michael and Parilee’s, I’d take the subway to work in the mornings; in the evenings, I occasionally opted to walk home. It’s a long walk (about an hour and a half to the Upper East Side), but there’s no better way to see the city. Along the way, I passed by places like Rockefeller Center, the Empire State Building, and Times Square. Sometimes I’d stop in Central Park, eat a light dinner that I packed, and people-watch. On my first day off on Saturday, I explored Chinatown in the morning and got <em>ji tui fan</em> for lunch.</p><p>I’ve seen some friends while I’ve been here, too. Akina introduced me to <a href="http://xianfoods.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Xi’an Famous Foods</a>, and I’ve already been back to eat there multiple times (their cold-skin noodles have been the best thing I’ve eaten here so far). Laura was in town, too. I hung out with her in Brooklyn on Saturday; we saw the Brooklyn Museum with Kelly, strolled through Prospect Park with Dmitry, and then had dinner and drinks. I also had dinner the following week (soba in SoHo) with Carolyn, who I also knew from school.</p><p>This past Saturday, I played basketball in the morning with Dmitry in Crown Heights. I moved into my sublet in the East Village later that afternoon. I crammed into a crowded subway car and then labored down 14th Street carrying my stuff. The place was a mess when I arrived, but I’ve been slowly cleaning and making it feel like a home, somewhat. That night, I returned to Brooklyn for Dmitry’s house party, and I saw even more people from Berkeley, like McKenna and Isi.</p></section><footer class="post-footer container container--narrow"><ul class="post-tag-list"><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/daily/">daily</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/food/">food</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/new-york/">new york</a></li></ul></footer></article><article class="post" data-post-id="cik1p1aas0026dlxq9dtiz5tg"><header class="post-header container container--narrow"><a href="/2015/pre-new-york/"><time class="post-date" datetime="2015-07-23T00:54:17.000Z">Wed, 22 Jul 2015</time><h1 class="post-title">Pre-New York</h1></a></header><section class="post-content container container--narrow"><ul><li>ordered a new MacBook Pro to replace my old one of five years, which had gotten way too slow; took a few days to get the new one set up just how I like it</li><li>got new all-black Vans; they’ll be my New York shoes</li><li>SW Seafood in Irvine with Mom, Uncle Ray, Aunt Jenny, Alex, and Wei; it was a going-away dinner, of sorts, for me and Alex, who’s going to New Orleans next month for school</li><li>bought and installed a new printer for Mom</li><li>Souplantation for dinner with Josh, Joyce, Randy, Youmi, and Leah; drinks and hanging out at Youmi’s afterwards</li><li>laundry, packing, and apartment hunting</li></ul></section><footer class="post-footer container container--narrow"><ul class="post-tag-list"><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/daily/">daily</a></li></ul></footer></article><article class="post" data-post-id="cik1p1aax0028dlxqnppnu5fk"><header class="post-header container container--narrow"><a href="/2015/july-4th/"><time class="post-date" datetime="2015-07-18T18:46:02.000Z">Sat, 18 Jul 2015</time><h1 class="post-title">July 4th</h1></a></header><section class="post-content container container--narrow"><p>In early July, I’d still been going to design and developer meetups pretty regularly. I also met up with Renee a couple times to catch up and chat about work; she’s at a design agency in Irvine.</p><p>Laura was in town for the July 4th weekend; on night of the 3rd, we went to 1000 steps beach along with a couple of her friends from Boston.</p><p>On the 4th, I had lunch with a girl I met earlier in the week, Misa. I was supposed to take her to a Japanese restaurant (she’s from Japan), but it was closed for the holiday so we ate at a Taiwanese place nearby. In the evening, I met up with Randy, Brian, and Nasir for hot pot at Little Sheep, firework-watching at El Conejo Park, and then some beers at Randy’s.</p><p>Josh, Joyce, and I took a day trip to LA on the 5th to see a house concert for classical music. When we got back home, we had Souplantation for dinner with Kristina and her friend Tina.</p><p>The next couple of days, Josh and I hung out and played music together. We saw Youmi in the park on the 6th, and made dinner plans on the 7th, and invited her friend Leah, Randy, and Brian. We had a nice dinner at a Cuban restaurant at the Lab in Costa Mesa.</p><p>I drove up to Venice on the 9th to visit an old friend from Berkeley, Bez; he’s been working at a startup on Abbot Kinney, so we had a chat and he showed me around.</p><p>On the 11th, Brian stopped by in the late afternoon to play around with Josh’s drum machine. Randy and Tiffany came over after dinner; the three of us took a stroll in the park around sunset and then listened to music afterwards.</p><p>During this time, I had also been talking with <a href="http://oak.is" target="_blank" rel="external">Oak</a>, a design studio in New York. I’d been following their work for a some time, and by chance I emailed them late last month when I saw they had an internship opening. Last weekend, I told them I wanted to take it.</p><p>The job lasts three months. I leave on Sunday, and start on Monday.</p></section><footer class="post-footer container container--narrow"><ul class="post-tag-list"><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/daily/">daily</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/july-4th/">july 4th</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/los-angeles/">los angeles</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/oc/">oc</a></li></ul></footer></article><article class="post" data-post-id="cik1p1ab5002edlxqslx4b3i0"><header class="post-header container container--narrow"><a href="/2015/duanwu-festival-and-meetups/"><time class="post-date" datetime="2015-06-30T01:36:08.000Z">Mon, 29 Jun 2015</time><h1 class="post-title">Duanwu Festival and meetups</h1></a></header><section class="post-content container container--narrow"><ul><li>watching basketball with Mom</li><li>jam session with Tiffany and Randy; it was a trip relive all the old tunes I used to play and listen to; I keep saying it, but it bears repeating: music used to be such a big part of my life, and I don’t want to lose it</li><li>social event at a bar in Long Beach, where I met some other OC designers</li><li>potluck dinner at Uncle Ray’s for the Duanwu Festival; I ate two zongzis</li><li>tacos with Alex at Perla’s</li><li>developers meetup in Venice; I wanted to see an apartment showing closer to downtown earlier in the day, so I made a day of it; I saw the La Brea Tar Pits, walked along Venice Beach, and had a really delicious lunch in Koreatown</li><li>baseball game with Tiffany; they now have a special Metrolink train for Angels games, so we took that</li><li>watching old episodes of <em>Community</em>; I admit I’m not immune to distractions, but I don’t mind as much any more; just trying to go with the flow</li></ul><p><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/4291520/journal-images/koreatown-lunch.jpg" alt="Lunch in Koreatown—grilled mackerel pike."></p></section><footer class="post-footer container container--narrow"><ul class="post-tag-list"><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/daily/">daily</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/food/">food</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/los-angeles/">los angeles</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/oc/">oc</a></li></ul></footer></article><article class="post" data-post-id="cik1p1ab6002jdlxqz1qnxhgw"><header class="post-header container container--narrow"><a href="/2015/reading/"><time class="post-date" datetime="2015-06-10T14:12:41.000Z">Wed, 10 Jun 2015</time><h1 class="post-title">Reading</h1></a></header><section class="post-content container container--narrow"><p>I’ve been doing a lot of design reading lately. It started when I was in San Jose and would go to the library to browse books for inspiration. Now I can’t get enough.</p><p>A couple weeks ago, I read the comprehensive <em>Meggs’ History of Graphic Design</em>. I never got a formal design education, so I wanted to get a solid foundation and put things in perspective historically. It was interesting to see which designs have stood the test of time and which designs look dated, in a bad way.</p><p>I also checked out a couple of information design books from the public library, <em>Envisioning Information</em> and <em>Beautiful Evidence</em> by Edward R. Tufte. He’s a big proponent of content. If the numbers are boring, then you’ve got the wrong numbers. And clutter is a failure of design, not an attribute of information; but, visual problems shouldn’t be fixed by sacrificing the resolution of the content.</p><p>One chapter from <em>Beautiful Evidence</em> really got to me in particular. It talked about the inherent problems of PowerPoint presentations—good for the confidence of bad presenters (who either don’t know what to say, or worse, don’t really have anything of substance to say), but horrible as a means of communicating something to an audience.</p><p>It’s just that people see, think, and read all the time at intensities greater than watching bulleted list items appear one by one on slide sequences. No wonder I never learned anything from listening to those crappy, templated PowerPoints that teachers and students presented in school. I only ever learned by (1) reading the textbook or (2) practicing or doing.</p><p>The issue is that PowerPoint presentations are used as a substitute for real thought. Smatterings of somewhat related words and phrases are certainly easier than writing full sentences.</p><p>We’ve gotten to a place as a society where we no longer want to think. We just want to mindlessly consume. You see it on the Internet, in the form of short, 140-character bursts of opinion and endless click-bait articles. Everything is dumbed down for us. Time is rarely left for deep thought, which is required for meaningful communication.</p><hr><p>When not reading, I’ve been working on building my personal brand—I designed and coded up my homepage and portfolio, and created themes for documents and presentations. I’ve just begun to reach out to people who’ve contacted me in the past about freelance work that I had to turn down while I was working on other projects.</p><p>For exercise, I’ve been going on walks (and sometimes uphill sprints) along the trails behind El Conejo Park and working on my jump shot in the side yard.</p><p>For food, I’ve been mostly cooking, still—dishes like braised gluten and shiitake, pork belly, slow-roasted chicken, carrot and potato fries, omelettes, and Asian greens from the farmer’s market. I also got a burger (not that good) at dinner with Brian, Randy, and Tariq for Brian’s birthday. Jen was in town this past weekend. She, Mom, and I went out to lunch with Tiffany and her mom at Hsi Lai Temple.</p><p>For entertainment, I’ve been watching the NBA playoffs with Mom. I get so emotionally invested in the games, but I’m trying not to. I take Warriors losses pretty hard, in part because I feel like I’ve grown up with this team. They’re down 2–1 right now in the finals. We’ll see how they respond.</p></section><footer class="post-footer container container--narrow"><ul class="post-tag-list"><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/books/">books</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/daily/">daily</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/food/">food</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/oc/">oc</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/reflection/">reflection</a></li></ul></footer></article><article class="post" data-post-id="cik1p1abb002pdlxqjx5knxwt"><header class="post-header container container--narrow"><a href="/2015/new-outlook/"><time class="post-date" datetime="2015-06-10T04:06:10.000Z">Wed, 10 Jun 2015</time><h1 class="post-title">New outlook</h1></a></header><section class="post-content container container--narrow"><p>Ten months ago, I reconnected with an old friend from school; I’d always had a crush on her but she always seemed to have a boyfriend. Things eventually ended between us, but the experience changed me. It changed my outlook on life. It made me see that, well, good things really can happen. I never thought they could happen to me, until they did. Sounds cheesy, but it’s true.</p><p>At that time, I kept coming back to this thought of “Why not me?” Since then, I’ve made some bold decisions. Other people have taken chances and pursued their passions. Why not me? Good things can happen, if you take action.</p></section><footer class="post-footer container container--narrow"><ul class="post-tag-list"><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/reflection/">reflection</a></li></ul></footer></article><article class="post" data-post-id="cik1p1abf002rdlxq8uukix45"><header class="post-header container container--narrow"><a href="/2015/new-plan/"><time class="post-date" datetime="2015-06-10T03:33:53.000Z">Tue, 9 Jun 2015</time><h1 class="post-title">New plan</h1></a></header><section class="post-content container container--narrow"><p>My plan, after I got back from my trip, was to find a job that I liked and then work for a few years to get more experience and build up my network and portfolio. Then I’d have skills and resources to pursue freelancing.</p><p>The thing is, after searching for jobs for a while, I’m just not sure there’s a conventional job that I would like. At least, they’d be hard to come by. But why invest the time and energy into finding out? My new plan now is to skip the “get more experience” step and just start freelancing—it was my eventual goal, so I might as well start making mistakes and learning from them, sooner rather than later. Anything I need to learn I can learn as I go, I feel. As far as meeting people and growing my network, there are meetups and professional organizations, like AIGA.</p><p>I’m betting on myself, and trusting that if you do good work, people will notice.</p></section><footer class="post-footer container container--narrow"><ul class="post-tag-list"><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/reflection/">reflection</a></li></ul></footer></article></main><footer class="page-footer"><nav class="nav nav--pagination"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="nav-item"><a href="/" class="nav-link">Previous</a></li><li class="nav-item"><a href="/" class="nav-link nav-link--center">2 of 15</a></li><li class="nav-item"><a href="/page/3/" class="nav-link">Next</a></li></ul></nav></footer><script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.0.3/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/js/all.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">!function(e,a,t,n,c,o,s){e.GoogleAnalyticsObject=c,e[c]=e[c]||function(){(e[c].q=e[c].q||[]).push(arguments)},e[c].l=1*new Date,o=a.createElement(t),s=a.getElementsByTagName(t)[0],o.async=1,o.src=n,s.parentNode.insertBefore(o,s)}(window,document,"script","//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js","ga"),ga("create","UA-15132368-5","auto"),ga("send","pageview");</script></body></html>
