There was a fun game where you could guess the number of items in a jar. You write down the answer, and the closest guess without going over wins the contents of that jar (there were jars of limes, of peppers, and of hot tamales). I was very close for all three, but didn’t end up winning. But it was fun to play. If I throw a party I’m definitely going to do this.</p><p>The other memorable activity was the fortune teller. I was curious so I had mine told. I asked her, “How do I stay inspired?”. That was my New Year’s resolution, after all. She had me shuffle a deck of tarot cards and flip over four. In her reading, she had suggested that I’m often stuck in the same patterns of thought or ideas that aren’t working. When that happens, I just need to relax. Furthermore, inspiration will come if I keep my mind open to new experiences and go with the flow, so to speak. Very good advice for anybody. The best ideas often come when you aren’t expecting them or even looking for them. Let life happen.</p><p>Saturday was a nice day. In the morning, I played tennis with Jason in Berkeley. Afterwards, I also stopped by Buffalo Exchange to trade in some old clothes for a new shirt. For lunch, I cooked bacon with Brussels sprouts and watched some of the NFL playoffs with Andrew and Didi.</p><p>At night, I hung out at Jen’s, where we ate leftover pork shoulder and fries and watched the “Fresh Off the Boat” video series, hosted by chef <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Huang" target="_blank" rel="external">Eddie Huang</a>. I was into it. In the series, he travels to various locations (Taiwan, Bay Area, Los Angeles); there, hosts treat him to local culture and cuisine. The episodes in Taiwan made me want to visit again, and perhaps approach it from a different perspective this time.</p><p>Today, I worked on redesigning my home page and watched the 49ers game at home. I also created a new layout for this blog.</p></section><footer class="post-footer container container--narrow"><ul class="post-tag-list"><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/berkeley/">berkeley</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/daily/">daily</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/food/">food</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/reflection/">reflection</a></li></ul></footer></article><article class="post" data-post-id="ciiexdftq00avjh0hvpt2y4b4"><header class="post-header container container--narrow"><a href="/2014/changes/"><time class="post-date" datetime="2014-01-09T05:00:00.000Z">Thu, 9 Jan 2014</time><h1 class="post-title">Changes</h1></a></header><section class="post-content container container--narrow"><p>With the new year has come some significant changes.</p><p>Akina and I had a mutual break up. It’s sad, for sure, but change happens. Hopefully, I won’t lose her as a friend. She’s still my best.</p><p>Things are have changed at my apartment, too. Andrew’s girlfriend Didi moved in. On top of that, we decided to get a cable plan and Andrew bought new TV over the break. In the end, it’s worked out that I’m actually going to be paying less in total rent and utilities than I was previously.</p><p>Finally, I’ve purchased the iPad Air. In fact I’m writing this post on the new device. I’ve been contemplating getting an iPad for several months, and I finally just went for it. I walked to the Apple Store at Bay Street earlier this evening and bought it. I felt like if I was going to get it eventually, I might as well get it sooner rather than later.</p><p>Besides using it for reading (blogs, news, digital books), I plan to use the iPad largely to take notes. I’ve already begun to practice writing on it with the <a href="http://www.goodnotesapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">GoodNotes</a> app. Eventually, I want to get comfortable enough writing on it that it can replace almost all pen and paper in my life. For me, in this way, the iPad is a truly inspirational product—a tool that is powerful, useful, and simplifies our lives. Hopefully, by using it, some of that inspiration will rub off on me.</p></section><footer class="post-footer container container--narrow"><ul class="post-tag-list"><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/daily/">daily</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/reflection/">reflection</a></li></ul></footer></article><article class="post" data-post-id="ciiexdftu00ayjh0htupv48h7"><header class="post-header container container--narrow"><a href="/2014/end-of-break/"><time class="post-date" datetime="2014-01-07T05:00:00.000Z">Tue, 7 Jan 2014</time><h1 class="post-title">End of break</h1></a></header><section class="post-content container container--narrow"><p><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/4291520/journal-images/grapevine-2.jpg" alt="Driving thought the Grapevine back up to the Bay."></p><p>I had to work the last few days I was home, unfortunately.
