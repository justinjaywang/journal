I made my way around town by bike or foot, and occasionally public transit. I was against cars and resented having our environments shaped by them. I never thought that in a few short years, I’d end up having to drive a car to work every day.</p><p>When I first started working at Vertigo, I compared the different transportation options:</p><ol><li>There’s driving. Since I live near the freeway and the office is right off the freeway, it takes 15 minutes door to door. It’s nice because it’s a reverse commute.</li><li>There’s a bus that runs up San Pablo from Oakland to Point Richmond. But it takes upwards of an hour and a half. One way. Walking to the bus station alone takes 15 minutes.</li><li>There’s BART. But I would have to take the Emery Go Round shuttle to the BART, ride the BART up to Richmond, and then take another courtesy shuttle to the office. Comparable in time to taking the bus, but it involves transfers and is slightly more expensive.</li></ol><p>Clearly, driving is the most convenient option. I would like to take public transportation, I really would. And if there were a nice bike path, I would even consider biking. But the infrastructure to do so safely and easily isn’t there.</p><p>The public transportation options are just as expensive as driving a car (and much more costly in terms of time). So why would I not drive? I’m sure a lot of people feel this way, too. There’s a reason why there so many cars out on the road.</p><p>My thinking is: unless a better altenative is available, I’m going to keep driving to work. Turns out that I’m a big fan of parking lots.</p></section><footer class="post-footer container container--narrow"><ul class="post-tag-list"><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/reflection/">reflection</a></li></ul></footer></article><article class="post" data-post-id="cikmr5kpz00g2i96tn1yezh8c"><header class="post-header container container--narrow"><a href="/2013/apartment/"><time class="post-date" datetime="2013-04-07T04:00:00.000Z">Sun, 7 Apr 2013</time><h1 class="post-title">Apartment</h1></a></header><section class="post-content container container--narrow"><p><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/4291520/journal-images/bridgewater.jpg" alt="The courtyard at the Bridgewater apartment complex."></p><p>I’ve been so busy the last few months I haven’t put in a word about my apartment.</p><p>My room is set up just the way I want, with minimal furnishings and adornment.

Honestly, I went through a mini-crisis today. Am I where I thought I would be/want to be at this point in my life?</p><p>I’m still getting used to full-time work schedule, but I’m finding it hard to fit in side projects. In the morning I’ll get up and go to work. After work, I’ll cook, eat dinner, wash the dishes, and before I know it it’s 9:30 and I’m about ready to knock out in bed. I might read some blog posts, but don’t really have any mental energy to create anything that requires a lot of concentration.</p><p>Maybe I’m still far too early in my career to be thinking this. I’m at Vertigo to get real-world experience and learn as much as I can. Sometimes I’m not sure I’m the type to work for a boss, though. I wanna do my own thing. I wanna create great products. I wanna make a dent in the universe before I die. I’m definitely the type that lives to work, not work to live.</p><p>It’s probably true that a lot of my feelings right now are just because I’m turning a year older and they’ll probably blow over in a few days. Part of me feels like I wasted so many good years in school. Five and half years is a long time to be doing any one thing. But my time in school was indispensable.</p><p>Goals for this year of my life:</p><ul><li>Get started investing</li><li>Gain work experience</li><li>Design and develop an iOS app and submit to the App Store</li><li>Check in to places I go to using Foursquare so I can quantify myself, <a href="http://feltron.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Feltron-style</a></li><li>Develop my writing style and improve verbal communication</li><li>Improve my people skills (apply suggestions from <em>How to Win Friends and Influence People</em>)</li><li>Take pictures</li><li>Document my life</li><li>Stay in shape</li><li>Weekly assessments to improve myself</li></ul></section><footer class="post-footer container container--narrow"><ul class="post-tag-list"><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/birthdays/">birthdays</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/reflection/">reflection</a></li></ul></footer></article><article class="post" data-post-id="cikmr5kqs00gmi96tksf3696s"><header class="post-header container container--narrow"><a href="/2013/point-reyes/"><time class="post-date" datetime="2013-03-10T05:00:00.000Z">Sun, 10 Mar 2013</time><h1 class="post-title">Point Reyes</h1></a></header><section class="post-content container container--narrow"><p><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/4291520/journal-images/akina-jumping.jpg" alt="Akina jumping."></p><p><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/4291520/journal-images/justin-jumping.jpg" alt="Me jumping."></p><p><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/4291520/journal-images/point-reyes.jpg" alt="Looking down at the coast at Point Reyes."></p><p>Day trip to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_reyes" target="_blank" rel="external">Point Reyes</a> with Akina, Brendan, and Jen.</p></section><footer class="post-footer container container--narrow"><ul class="post-tag-list"><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/point-reyes/">point reyes</a></li></ul></footer></article><article class="post" data-post-id="cikmr5kqu00gpi96tjxc55vh2"><header class="post-header container container--narrow"><a href="/2013/driving/"><time class="post-date" datetime="2013-03-09T05:00:00.000Z">Sat, 9 Mar 2013</time><h1 class="post-title">Driving</h1></a></header><section class="post-content container container--narrow"><p>I’m spending a lot of time driving.
