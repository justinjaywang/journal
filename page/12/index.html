This past weekend, I took her up on her offer.</p><p>We flew in on Saturday and immediately did some exploring—we grabbed lunch from one of Portland’s many food carts, did some window shopping, and visited the <a href="http://portlandartmuseum.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">Portland Art Museum</a> which had a very cool bicycle design exhibit. That night, we ate an excellent dinner at <a href="http://www.pokpokpdx.com/home" target="_blank" rel="external">Pok Pok</a> and then headed downtown to catch a show.</p><p>Sunday, we went to a farmer’s market and cooked lunch before taking the light rail across the Willamette to do some more exploring on foot. That evening, we ate at <a href="http://bokebowl.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Boke Bowl</a>.</p><p>Monday through Wednesday we commuted via light rail to the office. The vibe was friendly and intimate. Nina and I worked in the conference room. Lunch at the food carts during those days; Monday was with Jason, Tuesday was with Dan. On Tuesday night we had dinner in Southwest Portland at <a href="http://www.luclackitchen.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Lúc Lác</a>.</p><p>I’m glad I went; it was an enjoyable trip.
