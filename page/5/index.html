I was inspired by reading <a href="http://zenhabits.net/archives/" target="_blank" rel="external">Zen Habits</a>, which talks about finding simplicity in our lives. For meals, I was cooking a lot of what I had left over, including a risotto of sorts, with brown rice and chicken stock.</p><p>On Saturday, I had Koryo for dinner with Akina and played board games afterwards at Theresa’s house with Jason, Irena, and some of their friends. On Tuesday, I loaded up the car with my belongings during the day and watched opening night of the NBA at Brendan’s during the evening. Early the next morning, I left for home.</p><p><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/4291520/journal-images/aquatic-park.jpg" alt="Geese at the Berkeley Aquatic Park."></p></section><footer class="post-footer container container--narrow"><ul class="post-tag-list"><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/berkeley/">berkeley</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/books/">books</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/daily/">daily</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/food/">food</a></li></ul></footer></article><article class="post" data-post-id="cik14w9eh005j0vxq3p8xsqcw"><header class="post-header container container--narrow"><a href="/2014/returning-home/"><time class="post-date" datetime="2014-10-19T19:22:03.000Z">Sun, 19 Oct 2014</time><h1 class="post-title">Returning home</h1></a></header><section class="post-content container container--narrow"><p>After seven years, I’m finally returning home.

And moving back to the place where I grew up will be even nicer. I’m a much different person than I was when I first left for school, for sure. But some things are still the same.

It had some interesting stuff, and I always enjoy thinking holistically about digital interfaces. It keeps me inspired. I also went through some of my bookmarked Medium articles.</p><p>This week, I updated and themed my <a href="http://justinjaywang.tumblr.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Tumblr blog</a> and moved my journal from Scriptogram to a <a href="http://hexo.io/" target="_blank" rel="external">Hexo</a>-generated static site hosted on GitHub pages.

After basketball on Thursday evening, I invited Jen and Brendan over for dinner. I made lu rou fan with fried tofu, preserved turnip omelette, and cabbage.</p><p>Lately, I’ve been cooking a lot with freezer and pantry ingredients so I can use them up before I move back to SoCal. Just like in <em>Chopped</em>, the constraints with which I had to work forced me to be creative with what dishes I made. My favorites were (1) tuna fried rice with a frozen vegetable mix of green beans, corn, peas, and carrots and (2) an anchovy and chive tomato sauce that I ate over rice.</p></section><footer class="post-footer container container--narrow"><ul class="post-tag-list"><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/daily/">daily</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/food/">food</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/marin/">marin</a></li></ul></footer></article><article class="post" data-post-id="cik14w9em005q0vxqgoorhfqe"><header class="post-header container container--narrow"><a href="/2014/week-two/"><time class="post-date" datetime="2014-10-11T04:00:00.000Z">Sat, 11 Oct 2014</time><h1 class="post-title">Week two</h1></a></header><section class="post-content container container--narrow"><p>I’ve been as productive as ever during this, my second week of unemployment.</p><p>My routine has been to wake up early, do push-ups while I microwave oatmeal, eat the oatmeal, and start working. Around lunchtime, I go for a run along the Berkeley Aquatic Park or a swim in the pool at my apartment complex. After fixing and eating lunch (usually steamed brown rice topped with vegetables, eggs, salted turnip), I get back to work until dinnertime. I even find myself motivated to work after dinner, too.</p><p>I accomplished my goal of finishing up the remaining work on the project (a website prototype), so that I can have it as a portfolio piece.</p><p>Other events from the week:</p><ul><li>I saw one of my favorite bands, the Drums, play in San Francisco on Monday night with Grace.

Already I can feel that the pace of my life has picked up, and that’s a good thing.</p><p>My first move was to pursue this startup idea with Brian, and begin recruiting people to join. On Sunday, I met with Edmund for brunch at <a href="http://www.suppenkuche.com/welcome.html" target="_blank" rel="external">Suppenküche</a>. More lunches and dinners with friends throughout the week to chat: Monday night, sushi with Brandon; Tuesday night, Vietnamese food with the BI alums; Wednesday, lunch with Edmund (phở) and then dinner with Pavel (Z &amp; Y Chinese). As such, I had crashed at Brian’s Tuesday night and then spent Wednesday in the city working at a café and at the Metreon.</p><p>Saturday, I stopped by the Hardly Strictly Bluegrass Festival at Golden Gate Park with Cole and Felicia. They drove, and I provided the sandwiches from Togo’s. That night, I went over to Jen’s for dinner while we watched the baseball playoffs.</p><p>Working on this idea full-time during the week gave me a glimpse of what it’d be like long-term. I could see fairly quickly it wasn’t going to work out. The moments of severe doubt outweighed the moments of inspiration. The biggest questions I had were (1) is this the right team? (2) is this product something that people want? I’d be lying to myself if I said yes. I knew in my heart it wasn’t the right opportunity. I met with Brian to tell him on Sunday night.</p></section><footer class="post-footer container container--narrow"><ul class="post-tag-list"><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/concerts/">concerts</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/daily/">daily</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/food/">food</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/reflection/">reflection</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/san-francisco/">san francisco</a></li></ul></footer></article><article class="post" data-post-id="cik14w9es00630vxq5lfn4kr9"><header class="post-header container container--narrow"><a href="/2014/taking-the-plunge/"><time class="post-date" datetime="2014-09-27T04:00:00.000Z">Sat, 27 Sep 2014</time><h1 class="post-title">Taking the plunge</h1></a></header><section class="post-content container container--narrow"><p>I left Vertigo. Yesterday was my last day. I had been giving this matter a lot of thought, for a while now. I know it’s the right decision.</p><p>I learned a lot from the people I worked with and interacted with during the just-under two years there. I was fortunate to have such a first full-time job.
