It’s sad, for sure, but change happens. Hopefully, I won’t lose her as a friend. She’s still my best.</p><p>Things are have changed at my apartment, too. Andrew’s girlfriend Didi moved in. On top of that, we decided to get a cable plan and Andrew bought new TV over the break. In the end, it’s worked out that I’m actually going to be paying less in total rent and utilities than I was previously.</p><p>Finally, I’ve purchased the iPad Air. In fact I’m writing this post on the new device. I’ve been contemplating getting an iPad for several months, and I finally just went for it. I walked to the Apple Store at Bay Street earlier this evening and bought it. I felt like if I was going to get it eventually, I might as well get it sooner rather than later.</p><p>Besides using it for reading (blogs, news, digital books), I plan to use the iPad largely to take notes. I’ve already begun to practice writing on it with the <a href="http://www.goodnotesapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">GoodNotes</a> app. Eventually, I want to get comfortable enough writing on it that it can replace almost all pen and paper in my life. For me, in this way, the iPad is a truly inspirational product—a tool that is powerful, useful, and simplifies our lives. Hopefully, by using it, some of that inspiration will rub off on me.</p></section><footer class="post-footer container container--narrow"><ul class="post-tag-list"><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/daily/">daily</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/reflection/">reflection</a></li></ul></footer></article><script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.0.3/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/js/all.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">!function(e,a,t,n,c,o,s){e.GoogleAnalyticsObject=c,e[c]=e[c]||function(){(e[c].q=e[c].q||[]).push(arguments)},e[c].l=1*new Date,o=a.createElement(t),s=a.getElementsByTagName(t)[0],o.async=1,o.src=n,s.parentNode.insertBefore(o,s)}(window,document,"script","//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js","ga"),ga("create","UA-15132368-6","auto"),ga("send","pageview");</script></body></html>
