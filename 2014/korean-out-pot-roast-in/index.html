We were originally planning to go to a place in Oakland’s Chinatown, but it was closed so we ended up at Jong Ga House. I ordered fried flatfish, which was excellent paired with banchan and rice.</p><p>The work week was fine. We’re now really in the last stages of the project before the deadline. Just have to push through to the end.</p><p>To celebrate the end of the week, I had Brendan and Jen over for pot roast on Friday night. Earlier in the week, I had also made chicken with almond sesame sauce and Persian cucumber, using rotisserie chicken breast and leftover almond butter.</p><p>I’ve started to document the process of making some of my projects (namely llllyrics and BPM), in an effort to update my portfolio of work. I had the idea to use <a href="https://medium.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Medium</a> to write the story of the project and am currently writing and editing.</p><p>Today, I went over to Jen’s to play some tennis, eat oxtail soup she made, and watch football.</p></section><footer class="post-footer container container--narrow"><ul class="post-tag-list"><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/daily/">daily</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/emeryville/">emeryville</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/food/">food</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/oakland/">oakland</a></li></ul></footer></article><script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.0.3/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/js/all.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">!function(e,a,t,n,c,o,s){e.GoogleAnalyticsObject=c,e[c]=e[c]||function(){(e[c].q=e[c].q||[]).push(arguments)},e[c].l=1*new Date,o=a.createElement(t),s=a.getElementsByTagName(t)[0],o.async=1,o.src=n,s.parentNode.insertBefore(o,s)}(window,document,"script","//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js","ga"),ga("create","UA-15132368-5","auto"),ga("send","pageview");</script></body></html>
