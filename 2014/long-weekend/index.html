I was hoping to make good progress on my portfolio, but that didn’t happen. I should have just resigned myself to that fact from the start and taken it easy—which I did, for the most part.</p><ul><li>On Friday night, I was in bed by 8pm but woke up a couple hours later and watched <em>Lost in Translation</em>.</li><li>On Saturday, I hung out in the city: lunch at <a href="http://missionchinesefood.com/sf/" target="_blank" rel="external">Mission Chinese Food</a> and later shopping (got a custom shirt at <a href="http://taylorstitch.com/pages/custom" target="_blank" rel="external">Taylor Stitch</a>) and exploring. Later in the evening, I shot hoops with Brendan and Jen and watched some NBA All-Star festivities.</li><li>On Sunday, I ran into my old friend Ben when I was out looking at soccer cleats. I met up with him later in the day at his new place in Oakland, which he bought a month ago and has been undertaking the ambitious project of fixing it up.</li><li>On Monday, I made vichyssoise and had Jen and Brendan over for lunch. I took a nap in the afternoon and also played guitar for the second time is as many days.</li></ul></section><footer class="post-footer container container--narrow"><ul class="post-tag-list"><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/daily/">daily</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/food/">food</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/oakland/">oakland</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/san-francisco/">san francisco</a></li></ul></footer></article><script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.0.3/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/js/all.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">!function(e,a,t,n,c,o,s){e.GoogleAnalyticsObject=c,e[c]=e[c]||function(){(e[c].q=e[c].q||[]).push(arguments)},e[c].l=1*new Date,o=a.createElement(t),s=a.getElementsByTagName(t)[0],o.async=1,o.src=n,s.parentNode.insertBefore(o,s)}(window,document,"script","//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js","ga"),ga("create","UA-15132368-5","auto"),ga("send","pageview");</script></body></html>
