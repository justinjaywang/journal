Already I can feel that the pace of my life has picked up, and that’s a good thing.</p><p>My first move was to pursue this startup idea with Brian, and begin recruiting people to join. On Sunday, I met with Edmund for brunch at <a href="http://www.suppenkuche.com/welcome.html" target="_blank" rel="external">Suppenküche</a>. More lunches and dinners with friends throughout the week to chat: Monday night, sushi with Brandon; Tuesday night, Vietnamese food with the BI alums; Wednesday, lunch with Edmund (phở) and then dinner with Pavel (Z &amp; Y Chinese). As such, I had crashed at Brian’s Tuesday night and then spent Wednesday in the city working at a café and at the Metreon.</p><p>Saturday, I stopped by the Hardly Strictly Bluegrass Festival at Golden Gate Park with Cole and Felicia. They drove, and I provided the sandwiches from Togo’s. That night, I went over to Jen’s for dinner while we watched the baseball playoffs.</p><p>Working on this idea full-time during the week gave me a glimpse of what it’d be like long-term. I could see fairly quickly it wasn’t going to work out. The moments of severe doubt outweighed the moments of inspiration. The biggest questions I had were (1) is this the right team? (2) is this product something that people want? I’d be lying to myself if I said yes. I knew in my heart it wasn’t the right opportunity. I met with Brian to tell him on Sunday night.</p></section><footer class="post-footer container container--narrow"><ul class="post-tag-list"><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/concerts/">concerts</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/daily/">daily</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/food/">food</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/reflection/">reflection</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/san-francisco/">san francisco</a></li></ul></footer></article><script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.0.3/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/js/all.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">!function(e,a,t,n,c,o,s){e.GoogleAnalyticsObject=c,e[c]=e[c]||function(){(e[c].q=e[c].q||[]).push(arguments)},e[c].l=1*new Date,o=a.createElement(t),s=a.getElementsByTagName(t)[0],o.async=1,o.src=n,s.parentNode.insertBefore(o,s)}(window,document,"script","//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js","ga"),ga("create","UA-15132368-6","auto"),ga("send","pageview");</script></body></html>
