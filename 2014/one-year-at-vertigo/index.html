Overall, I like the direction I’m headed. This week also happened to be my one year anniversary at Vertigo.</p><ul><li>Warriors game on Monday night with Brendan and Jen.</li><li>I made Malaysian chicken curry and ate that the first few days of the week. Later in the week, I made a recipe of my own creation—a soup—using leftover rotisserie chicken carcass and coconut milk as a flavor base, with green beans, shiitake mushrooms, red dates, and star anise. I also mixed in a little soy sauce and topped it off with fried shallots and black pepper.</li><li>I hung out with Akina on Wednesday night.</li><li>Basketball game on Thursday at lunch. Our team was undefeated.</li><li>Friday, Tony took me out to <a href="http://www.tacubaya.net/" target="_blank" rel="external">Tacubaya</a> in Berkeley, for a sort of an anniversary lunch. We had a good, honest talk about Vertigo and design.</li><li>Yesterday, I went to work early and stayed a little later since it’s crunch time for our project. After work, I just hung out at home, watching Jeopardy with my roommates.</li><li>Saturday, I got up early and worked on my portfolio. For lunch, I met up with Nina in Berkeley at <a href="http://greatchinaberkeley.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Great China</a>. The mei cai kou rou was delicious, and is something I’d like to try making. Later, I had afternoon tea with Brittany at <a href="http://www.ashateahouse.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Asha Tea House</a>.</li><li>I had pleasant experiences at both locations. The food and tea were excellent, and I had good talks with the people I was with.</li><li>Today, I played tennis and afterwards had Jen and Brendan over to eat some cassoulet (or a version of it) that I made, with northern white beans, sausage, bacon, and chicken thighs.</li></ul></section><footer class="post-footer container container--narrow"><ul class="post-tag-list"><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/berkeley/">berkeley</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/daily/">daily</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/food/">food</a></li></ul></footer></article><script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.0.3/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/js/all.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">!function(e,a,t,n,c,o,s){e.GoogleAnalyticsObject=c,e[c]=e[c]||function(){(e[c].q=e[c].q||[]).push(arguments)},e[c].l=1*new Date,o=a.createElement(t),s=a.getElementsByTagName(t)[0],o.async=1,o.src=n,s.parentNode.insertBefore(o,s)}(window,document,"script","//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js","ga"),ga("create","UA-15132368-6","auto"),ga("send","pageview");</script></body></html>
