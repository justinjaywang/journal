Yesterday was my last day. I had been giving this matter a lot of thought, for a while now. I know it’s the right decision.</p><p>I learned a lot from the people I worked with and interacted with during the just-under two years there. I was fortunate to have such a first full-time job. At the same time, I had sensed that my growth and learning were stagnating and that it was time to move on.</p><p>Vertigo was an important chapter in my life; for now, though, on to the next one. At this point in my life, I’m ready take a chance and bet on myself. That I can learn every minute of every day. That I can pursue ideas that I think can positively affect the world. That I can be fulfilled in my work.</p><p>I feel extremely liberated. Also a little scared, but in a good way. It’s like you’re jumping into icy cold water. Daunting at first, but how exhilarating the adrenaline rush is! You feel alive for the first time in a long time.</p></section><footer class="post-footer container container--narrow"><ul class="post-tag-list"><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/reflection/">reflection</a></li></ul></footer></article><script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.0.3/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/js/all.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">!function(e,a,t,n,c,o,s){e.GoogleAnalyticsObject=c,e[c]=e[c]||function(){(e[c].q=e[c].q||[]).push(arguments)},e[c].l=1*new Date,o=a.createElement(t),s=a.getElementsByTagName(t)[0],o.async=1,o.src=n,s.parentNode.insertBefore(o,s)}(window,document,"script","//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js","ga"),ga("create","UA-15132368-5","auto"),ga("send","pageview");</script></body></html>
