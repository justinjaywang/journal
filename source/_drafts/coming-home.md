- after seven years, I'm returning home (no place like it)
- it's been a long time
- I'm so much different than I was when I left

- want to get out of the tech bubble
- learn about myself by looking back at what helped shaped me early on
- hope to find what i'm looking for
- get inspired, get different perspectives on things from the people down there

goals:

- cook
- plenty of sun, exercise
- see friends in SoCal
- spend time with mom
- inspiration
- do great work
- learn a lot, every day. work tirelessly to improve my skills.
