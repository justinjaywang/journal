### plan

- ~~work for a number of years: get more visual design experience, learn from people better than me, build up my portfolio~~
- after that point, I'll have freedom to pursue freelance and can then live anywhere—Taipei, Berlin
- originally wanted to work for a number of years to get experience and build up my portfolio
- why not bypass that and start now? sooner I start learnings, making mistakes, the better

### priorities

- build portfolio by doing great work
- learn from other designers
- meet people, build up connections and social network

### possible routes to go down

#### tech product company, like Google, Dropbox, Facebook, Twitter.

- many good designers are in this route: andy chung, muan, allan yu, dave gamache, connor sears, loren brichter

#### design firm

- surrounded by designers, like-minded people
- historically, it seems a lot of designers went on this route: Michael Bierut, Jony Ive started out at a design firm

#### ~~startup~~

- have a lot of creative say
- have a chance to do great work
- cons: not the most stable, probably not good for my social life

- bonus ponts for global companies; if I stay with the company and grow with the company, there might be opportunity to work abroad

on my passions

- what separates me from my peers?
- my creativity, love for beauty
- people have always been saying to me what a good graphic designer I am
- looking at my old sketchbooks has been inspiring, get back to my true passion
- technology was just kind of a bubble, distracting from my purpose

---
### plan B

- if, after applying in earnest, I can't get a job doing what I want, then I'll consider applying to design schools

#### case for going to school

- build portfolio
- learn things I actually want to learn
- experience new things, a different city
- build up a network of design-y friends
- for example, now, there's no one I can reach out to for referrals for the field I want to work in

- frog at the bottom of a well right now

Just talked to Jen and Brendan for advice.

Can't sleep, won't sleep. Just had a moment of clarity.
- now my mind is swimming with these thoughts
- I'm excited at the possibility
- can bypass all this cruft and simply pursue being an independent designer.
- there was a reason I was procrastinating all this time in finding a job—I didn't want one
- I was turned off by all the politics, bureaucracy, inefficiency at a "normal" job
- I'm motivated enough, smart enough, talented enough to make it on my own and have the skills to do so
- optimizing quality time in life: can choose where to live, can go grocery shopping when it's not peak hours, can bypass traffic
- best piece of advice I got: nobody knows what they're doing, they're all just faking it

Things I need to do

### keep to a regimen

- read daily to keep up
- regular self-assessments to find areas of improvement
- best practices, always
- find social groups to not be isolated
- professional group: AIGA
- optimize
