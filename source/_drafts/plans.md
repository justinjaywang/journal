### plan

- work for a number of years: get more visual design experience, learn from people better than me, build up my portfolio
- after that point, I'll have freedom to pursue freelance and can then live anywhereâ€”Taipei, Berlin

### priorities

- build portfolio by doing great work
- learn from other designers
- meet people, build up connections and social network

### possible routes to go down

#### tech product company, like Google, Dropbox, Facebook, Twitter.

- many good designers are in this route: andy chung, muan, allan yu, dave gamache, connor sears, loren brichter

#### design firm

- surrounded by designers, like-minded people
- historically, it seems a lot of designers went on this route: Michael Bierut, Jony Ive started out at a design firm

#### ~~startup~~

- have a lot of creative say
- have a chance to do great work
- cons: not the most stable, probably not good for my social life

- bonus ponts for global companies; if I stay with the company and grow with the company, there might be opportunity to work abroad

on my passions

- what separates me from my peers?
- my creativity, love for beauty
- people have always been saying to me what a good graphic designer I am
- looking at my old sketchbooks has been inspiring, get back to my true passion
- technology was just kind of a bubble, distracting from my purpose

### plan B

- if, after applying in earnest, I can't get a job doing what I want, then I'll consider applying to design schools

#### case for going to school

- build portfolio
- learn things I actually want to learn
- experience new things, a different city
- build up a network of design-y friends
- for example, now, there's no one I can reach out to for referrals for the field I want to work in

- frog at the bottom of a well right now
