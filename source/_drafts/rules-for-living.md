1. *Do things the right way.*
2. *Do things with style.*
3. *Do things you should..*
4. *Be honest.*
5. *Be deliberate.*

Have a purpose. Know what you want and go for it. In the past I've done things without really knowing why I was doing it or thinking through it.

6. *Embrace discomfort.*
7. *Know what you donâ€™t know.*
8. *Keep your composure.*
9. *Mostly do things that are sustainable.*
10. *Never let anyone else slow you down.*
11. *Never feel sorry for yourself.*
12. *Love what you do.*
