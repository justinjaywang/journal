Food was the main theme. I had originally planned on stopping by Taipei for a just few days on the way back to America from Chengdu, but I suggested that Mom come and spend time with me there, where we could bond over food—eat some of our favorite dishes, try new ones, and get inspired.

The food I had in Chengdu was incredible, but Taiwanese cuisine is still my absolute favorite. It's comfort food, after all. This time around, I especially enjoyed Pacific saury—I prefer fried, and eaten whole (including the head and bittersweet-tasting innards) over rice. I also discovered the joys of eating guava out-of-hand. The inner portion, where the seeds are, is the best part—sweet, pungent, slimy, and just slightly salty. The rest of the favorite things I ate:

- king oyster mushroom
- stinky tofu, with pao cai
- lu wei, like dried tofu
- gobo root
- anchovies and peanuts
- beef pancake roll
- pork bone soup with winter melon
- fried gluten and peanuts
- pickled daikon
- steamed bun with red bean filling
- ke jia xiao chao (Hakka stir-fry)
- fried tofu skin
