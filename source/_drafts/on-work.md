- I'm well-rounded, and have a lot of skills in a lot of areas. i'm good at a lot of things.
- I think there's still room for someone like that, in spite of the propensity towards people that specialize in one skill and are really good at it. Master of all trades?
- At my old job, I just got the feeling I had to get away because I wasn't growing, I was stagnating. i kept thinking, there's gotta be something more. i have a lot of good ideas, and love to give.
- i have a wide varieties of interests, and can contribute in a lot of ways
- i'm ready to devote a few years, working in a great team to create something wonderful
- i enjoy having fun. i get along with most people quite well. i'd love to be able to have a family atmosphere, and love to come to work to see people.
- you know the nick drake song, "one of these things first"? that's how i feel
- you can't define me in one role. i'm multidimensional. i felt i was going down the path of one tunnel and all other tunnels were closing off. i wasn't getting to do all the other things i was good at, and couldn't contribute as much as i wanted.
- want to work with people i like, most of all. people of my age, who i'd want to hang out with
- work on something that matters
- when I look at the big picture, what really separates me from my peers? it's my creativity. i should be able to exercise that in my work.

Half a year ago, I took a chance on myself. I gave myself time and space to explore my purpose in life.

When I look at the big picture, what really separates me from my peers? It's my creativity. Always has been, ever since I was little. I felt like, at engineering school, I got away from that. I regretted studying so much. I was living life on autopilot, doing things without deliberation and really questioning why I was doing something. I vow to never to just live the life that's expected of me, but to live a life true to myself.

I should be able to utilize this skill in what I do to make a living. It would be a disservice to be stuck in a role where I can't exercise this skill on a daily basis. I want to contribute great work to the world.

I believe I'm well-rounded and have skills and interests in a lot of areas. I'm good at most things I do. You can't define me by titles, by one role only. I'm multidimensional. I can find a position that allows me to utilize this. The way our society is set up, though, makes it harder to pursue multiple arts. Less Renaissance men. Rather, just one specialization is optimal. I was going down the path of something I wasn't truly passionate about. At my old job, I felt like I was going down one tunnel and all other tunnels of opportunity were closing off. I had to get off the train before it went too far. I was getting to exercise all my skills, I had so much more to give that I wasn't giving. I felt like I wanted to contribute something to the world; I certainly wasn't doing that there.

Money is important, that's just the way it is. But it shouldn't drive my decision.

### plan

- work for a number of years: get more visual design experience, learn from people better than me, build up my portfolio
- after that point, I'll have freedom to pursue freelance and can then live anywhereâ€”Taipei, Berlin

### priorities

- build portfolio by doing great work
- learn from other designers
- meet people, build up connections and social network

### possible routes to go down

#### tech product company, like Google, Dropbox, Facebook, Twitter.

- many good designers are in this route: andy chung, muan, allan yu, dave gamache, connor sears, loren brichter

#### design firm

- surrounded by designers, like-minded people
- historically, it seems a lot of designers went on this route: Michael Bierut, Jony Ive started out at a design firm

#### ~~startup~~

- have a lot of creative say
- have a chance to do great work
- cons: not the most stable, probably not good for my social life

- bonus ponts for global companies; if I stay with the company and grow with the company, there might be opportunity to work abroad

on my passions

- what separates me from my peers?
- my creativity, love for beauty
- people have always been saying to me what a good graphic designer I am
- looking at my old sketchbooks has been inspiring, get back to my true passion
- technology was just kind of a bubble, distracting from my purpose

### plan B

- if, after applying in earnest, I can't get a job doing what I want, then I'll consider applying to design schools

#### case for going to school

- build portfolio
- learn things I actually want to learn
- experience new things, a different city
- build up a network of design-y friends
- for example, now, there's no one I can reach out to for referrals for the field I want to work in

- frog at the bottom of a well right now
