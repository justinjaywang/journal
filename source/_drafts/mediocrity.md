- should I accept that most people are mediocre? and accept a mediocre life?
- the thing that separated me at a young age was my artistic side, my creativity.
- i'm taking a bet on myself that I can succeed using the skills that make me different
- what already separates me from my peers? my creativity, my minimalistic aesthetic

thought experiment: imagine yourself in a history museum. or, write your obituary
