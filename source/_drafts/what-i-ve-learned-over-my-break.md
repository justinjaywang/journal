title: "What I've learned over my break"
tags:
- reflection
---

- taking a step back to gain some perspective
- stopped using social media, gone back to a slower pace; was kind of caught up in the tech bubble; step outside it, technology not dominating lives
- slower doesn't mean I'm not learning less, just more efficiently
- give up on appearances, not worry about comparing myself to others, or what people think of me; live for myself
- focus, learned to focus better
- clear my head better, to clear "the fog"
- learn to love what you do vs. do what you love
- focus on what's important to me and get my priorities in order: family, friends, relationships, etc. music, exercise, nature, wanting less stuff and enjoying what you have, doing things that are sustainable
- rules for living to guide the rest of my life

- have more of a plan for my career, more deliberate in my actions
- decision to live as an artist; do work you love, that's purposeful during the day. during nights, weekends, create things on the side

- I made the difficult decision to follow my intuition
- allow myself time and space to explore what it is that's my true purpose in my life
- felt my creativity was stagnating, wasn't doing the work that I knew I was capable of
- took a bet on myself; my drive, my creativity; if you do good work, people will notice
- why not me? why can't I pursue my passions

- projects: Trove prototype, journal (and Hexo theme), llllyrics, monograms, lists, photos
- portfolio, homepage
- reading: about zen (Zen Habits), Elements of Typographic Style, and Fresh Off the Boat, Meggs' History of Graphic Design, Edward Tufte, Typographic Design

- at this point, I'm keeping my options open, maintaining as many connections as I can
- putting myself in best position to succeed and create things, and take opportunities as they come
- want to be creating, making things of beauty and value, that make people's lives better
- like who I work with
