title: "What I've learned over my break"
tags:
- reflection
---

- taking a step back to gain some perspective
- stopped using social media, gone back to a slower pace
- slower doesn't mean I'm not learning less, just more efficiently
- give up on appearances, not worry about comparing myself to others, or what people think of me; live for myself
- focus, learned to focus better
- clear my head better, to clear "the fog"
- learn to love what you do vs. do what you love
- focus on what's important to me and get my priorities in order: family, friends, relationships, etc. music, exercise, nature, wanting less stuff and enjoying what you have, doing things that are sustainable
- rules for living to guide the rest of my life
- projects: Trove prototype, journal, llllyrics, monograms, lists, photos – ongoing projects that I'll have the rest of my life
- trip to Philippines to gain perspective
- take lots of pictures
- take lots of long walks, hikes
- hang out with old friends
- learn to appreciate what I have
