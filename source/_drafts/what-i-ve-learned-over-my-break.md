- taking a step back to gain some perspective
- stopped using social media, gone back to a slower pace
- slower doesn't mean I'm not learning less, just more efficiently
- give up on appearances, not worry about comparing myself to others, or what people think of me; live for myself
- focus, learned to focus better
- clear my head better, to clear "the fog"
- learn to love what you do vs. do what you love
- focus on what's important to me and get my priorities in order: family, friends, relationships, etc. music, exercise, nature, wanting less stuff and enjoying what you have, doing things that are sustainable
- rules for living to guide the rest of my life

- projects: Trove prototype, journal, llllyrics, monograms, lists, photos – ongoing projects that I'll have the rest of my life
- portfolio
- reading: about zen (Zen Habits), Elements of Typographic Style, and Fresh Off the Boat

- trip to Philippines to gain perspective
- take lots of pictures
- take lots of long walks, hikes
- hang out with old friends
- learn to appreciate what I have

- become more self aware
- come up with a plan for growth: my growth model
- habits: every week, month, year

- have more of a plan for my career, more deliberate in my actions
- decision to live as an artist; do work you love, that's purposeful during the day. during nights, weekends, create things on the side
