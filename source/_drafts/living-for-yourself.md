title: Living for yourself
tags:
- reflection

- live the life you want, not for others
- worried what people would think when I told them i quit my job and moved back home
- used to think spiritual stuff was kind of BS, now I understand
- used to wonder why people would quit a steady job. now i understand.
- that's the seemingly normal life
- not necessarily the best way to live
