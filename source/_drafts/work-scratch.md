- I'm well-rounded, and have a lot of skills in a lot of areas. i'm good at a lot of things.
- I think there's still room for someone like that, in spite of the propensity towards people that specialize in one skill and are really good at it. Master of all trades?
- At my old job, I just got the feeling I had to get away because I wasn't growing, I was stagnating. i kept thinking, there's gotta be something more. i have a lot of good ideas, and love to give.
- i have a wide varieties of interests, and can contribute in a lot of ways
- i'm ready to devote a few years, working in a great team to create something wonderful
- i enjoy having fun. i get along with most people quite well. i'd love to be able to have a family atmosphere, and love to come to work to see people.
- you know the nick drake song, "one of these things first"? that's how i feel
- you can't define me in one role. i'm multidimensional. i felt i was going down the path of one tunnel and all other tunnels were closing off. i wasn't getting to do all the other things i was good at, and couldn't contribute as much as i wanted.
- want to work with people i like, most of all. people of my age, who i'd want to hang out with
- work on something that matters
- when I look at the big picture, what really separates me from my peers? it's my creativity. i should be able to exercise that in my work.

By heading down one very specialized career path, I was closing off all other possible paths. So I got off the train. I wasn't getting to exercise all my skills, to my full capability. I had so much more to give that I wasn't giving. I felt like I wanted to contribute something to the world; I certainly wasn't doing that there.


I believe I'm capable of contributing talented in a lot of areas. In a society that favors specialization, that's a gift and a curse. Say I'm good at A, B, and C. I study A in school, and then go on to find work doing A. It benefits my career to dedicate time at honing A skills, at the expense of the other. I'm left to wonder what could have been, if I had chosen B, or even C. Better to be just good at A.

I'm good at most things I do. You can't define me by titles, by one role only. I'm multidimensional. I can find a position that allows me to utilize this. The way our society is set up, though, makes it harder to pursue multiple arts. Less Renaissance men. Rather, just one specialization is optimal. I was going down the path of something I wasn't truly passionate about.

Look at my peers in engineering school; I was different than them. I was also good at humanities.

When I look at the big picture, what really separates me from my peers? It's my creativity. It always has been, ever since I was little. I felt like, at engineering school, I got away from that. I regretted studying so much. I was living life on autopilot, doing things without deliberation and really questioning why I was doing something. I vow to never to just live the life that's expected of me, but to live a life true to myself.

I should be able to utilize this skill in what I do to make a living. It would be a disservice to be stuck in a role where I can't exercise this skill on a daily basis. I want to contribute great work to the world. work doesn't have to be work.


I only have one life to live; why not do what I love? I'm fortunate to be skilled enough and able where I can choose what I want to do, and pursue my dream job; not a lot of people get to do that. I don't want to be stuck in a life I don't want to live.

What i had was desirable to a lot of people, so it might seem strange that I walked away. but it was desirable to whom?

Money is important, that's just the way it is. But it shouldn't drive my decision.

Half a year ago, I took a chance on myself. I gave myself time and space to explore my purpose in life.

how do you make a living? by making money. by creating value in the world.
