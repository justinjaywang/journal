The couple of few weeks have been a whirlwind. I flew in the night of the 19th and started work the following Monday morning. My flight was delayed, too, so I ended up having to share a cab with the Australian woman I sat next to on the plane in order to arrive at Michael and Parilee's apartment barely before 11pm. I remember being so tired those first few days. I had to figure everything out on the go, but I survived.

The internship has been pretty great, overall. Can't complain. The guys are all super laid back, and I have a ton of freedom. Plus, they all have great taste and have built some beautiful and useful products. The office is shared by another creative agency and is in Union Square, so there's a ton of lunch options nearby ([Taboonette](http://taboonette.com/) and [Num Pang](http://numpangnyc.com/) are right around the corner).

Outside of work, I've been doing a lot of exploring. I walked back to Michael and Parilee's place after work a handful of times (they live in the Upper East Side, so it's an hour and a half walk), passing by places like Rockefeller Center, the Empire State Building, and Times Square along the way. Sometimes I'd stop in Central Park, eat a light dinner that I packed, and people watch. During my first day off on Saturday, I explored Chinatown in the morning and got *ji tui fan* for lunch.

I've gotten to see friends while I've been here, too. Akina introduced me to [Xi'an Famous Foods](http://xianfoods.com/), and I've already been back a few more times. Their cold-skin noodles are the best thing I've eaten here so far; the flavor is spot-on, the texture is chewy and delightful, and it's refreshing to eat in this kind of weather (hot and humid). I hung out in Brooklyn with Laura on Saturday; we saw the Brooklyn Museum with Kelly, strolled through Prospect Park with Dmitry, and then had dinner and drinks. I also had dinner in SoHo the following week (soba) with Carolyn, who I also knew from school.

This past Saturday, I played basketball in the morning with Dmitry in Crown Heights. In the afternoon, I moved into my sublet in the East Village. I crammed into a crowded subway car with my two bags (no room to spare) and then labored down 14th Street carrying my stuff. The place was a mess when I arrived, but I've been slowly cleaning and making it feel like a home, somewhat. That night, I returned to Brooklyn there. Dmitry invited me to his house party, and I saw even more people from Berkeley, like McKenna and Isi.
