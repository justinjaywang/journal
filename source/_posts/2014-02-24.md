- This past week was the last few days of the project at work. I'm ready to move on to a new one.
- On Wednesday after work, I had dinner at [Kao Sarn](http://kaosarnthaicuisine.com/) with my project manager Jason, who had flown down from Portland to attend meetings for a new project that's kicking off. I ordered the braised pork.
- [Vik's Chaat Corner](http://www.vikschaatcorner.com/) with Paul and Nina after work on Thursday. Probably the best Indian food I've had. But that's not saying that much.
- Pickup soccer on Wednesday night with Brendan.
- Pickup basketball on Saturday afternoon, also with Brendan.
- I cooked Malaysian chicken curry again. It was delicious.
- I made good progress on my portfolio this weekend.
- Jen, Brendan, Akina, and I went to a Cal men's basketball game last night; they pulled away in the final stretch to beat the Trojans.
