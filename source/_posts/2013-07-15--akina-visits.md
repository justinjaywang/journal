![Spoon Korean Bistro](/images/spoon.jpg)

Akina got a ride with a friend up to the Bay Area for the weekend. On Sunday, we finally got around to trying [Spoon Korean Bistro](http://www.spoonashby.com/spoon/) for brunch. It lived up to our expectations. I got dolsot bibimbap in a nice, hot stone bowl.

Later in the day we went to the [Exploratorium](http://www.exploratorium.edu/) in the city at its new Pier 15 location. *Despicable Me 2* at Shattuck Cinemas to cap off the night.
