I finished [llllyrics](http://llllyrics.com/) early last week. This past week, I've been working on another project, both for fun and to develop my graphic design skills. I also started reading [*The Elements of Typographic Style*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elements_of_Typographic_Style), a well-known book on typography and a must-read for designers. I'm still going on daily walks and cookingâ€”dishes such as soy-orange chicken; root vegetable curry; caramelized onion, mushroom, and asparagus frittata; plenty of vegetables; and salmon.
