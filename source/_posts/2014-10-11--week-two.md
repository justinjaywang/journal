I've been as productive as ever during this, my second week of unemployment.

My routine has been to wake up early, do push-ups while I microwave oatmeal, eat the oatmeal, and start working. Around lunchtime, I go for a run along the Berkeley Aquatic Park or a swim in the pool at my apartment complex. After fixing and eating lunch (usually steamed brown rice topped with vegetables, eggs, salted turnip), I get back to work until dinnertime. I even find myself motivated to work after dinner, too.

I accomplished my goal of finishing up the remaining work on the project (a website prototype), so that I can have it as a portfolio piece.

Other events from the week:

- I saw one of my favorite bands, the Drums, play in San Francisco on Monday night with Grace. This inspired me to play guitar later that night and several other times throughout the week.
- Tennis with Bee on Wednesday. Grocery shopping at 99 Ranch afterwards.
- Basketball on Thursday.
- I've been listening a number of [Stuff You Should Know](http://www.stuffyoushouldknow.com/podcasts/) podcasts. Every episode touches on a new subject, on anything from animal domestication to the Berlin Wall. If you're the curious type, I highly recommend it.
