I finished my portfolio. Thank goodness. I'd been working solely on it for the last two weeks.

For food, I've been cookingâ€”mostly veggies, but also *lu rou* with braised tofu, shiitake, carrot, and daikon. I also baked a raisin-walnut-sunflower seed bread.

There was, however, a period of a few days where I was eating out. I took Mom and Tiffany's mom walking at the regional park and we had Souplantation afterwards; Kaju Soft Tofu in Irvine with Mom before we went grocery shopping at 99 Ranch; California Fish Grill with Randy, Brian, and Nasir; and on Chinese New Year's Eve, Mom and I had hot pot for dinner at Uncle Ray's.

I've also been going on walks, reading, researching jobs, doing push-ups, shooting hoops in the side yard, catching the NBA and Modern Family on TV, listening to podcasts, and playing piano (Youth Lagoon and Bruno Mars).
