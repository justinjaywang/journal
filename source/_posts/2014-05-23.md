Dad, A-Gong, and A-Ma flew in Monday night; Jen and I drove to pick them up at SFO.

On Tuesday, I went running in Point Richmond with co-workers during lunch. The run was a little over 4 miles, with nice scenery along the water. You can see the city across the bay. Mom flew in in the afternoon. I met up with the family at the hotel after work, and we had dinner at Townhouse.

I took work off on Wednesday for Jen's graduation. Breakfast at the hotel in the morning. Lunch at [Hong Kong East Ocean Seafood Restaurant](http://www.hkeo.us/) on the Emeryville marina. We had a combination of leftovers and Wally's for dinner.

On Thursday, I went running again in the afternoon. On Friday evening, I flew down to join the rest of the family in Southern California.
