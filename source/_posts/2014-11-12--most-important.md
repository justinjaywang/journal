How do you lead a [simple life](http://zenhabits.net/simple-living-manifesto-72-ideas-to-simplify-your-life/)? By identifying what's most important to you, and focusing on these priorities.

What I value the most:

- relationships, with family and close friends
- creating thingsâ€”be it design, art, music, websites
- eating and cooking healthy, delicious food
- exercise, nature, and the outdoors
- music, and the emotions it can elicit
