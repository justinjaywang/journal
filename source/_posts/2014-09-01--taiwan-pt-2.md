The following couple of days we took a trip to the northeast coast. We arrived at the Qidu hostel the first day and took a bus out to Ho Ping Island to swim and take in the scenery. We spent the night in Keelung and ate at the Miaokou night market for dinner. The second day of the mini-trip we went to bussed to Fulong Beach and later, Jiufen.

In the late morning, we took a scenic bus ride back to Taipei that ended at Tamsui, where A-Bei picked us up. We had dinner at the Grand Hotel with Xiao A-Yi.

We met up with Xiao Jiu Jiu and his family the following morning and rode the Maokong gondolas and had beef noodle soup afterwards. A-Bei had us for the remainder of the day; we saw the Shihmen Dam and had dinner at a seafood restaurant. The next day, we had a relaxing day at A-Bei's house before playing basketball at a gym with one of A-Bei's friends and eating Hakka cuisine for dinner.
