Summary from the past week and a half:

- I went to the A's game on Monday night. Had a feast of wings, fries, and peanuts at the ballpark.
- I've been slowly making progress on my typeface project. I finally got to work in Illustrator, but realized I have my work cut out for me.
- Watching all these *Good Eats* episodes has inspired me to expand my cooking arsenal. I went to the restaurant supply store yesterday to get some stuff.
- I spent this weekend creating an update to my iPhone app, [BPM](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bpm-metronome/id668502976).
- Jennifer and Brendan came over tonight for dinner. I made Korean short rib, potatoes and carrots, pickled eggs, and winter melon soup. And Jen brought over the mooncake for dessert.
