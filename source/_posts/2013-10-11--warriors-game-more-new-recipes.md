This past week good. Better than most. I went to the Warriors-Kings preseason game with Paul on Monday night, along with some of his housemates and buddies. Since it was preseason, our seats were pretty decent for what we paid. Today, we went out for pho for Phoebe's last day. I had some beef noodle soup (on my list of recipes to try). We stopped by 99 Ranch and got some longan to eat for a snack back at the office.

Cooking highlights:

- I made 40 cloves and a chicken again last Sunday at Jen's
- Chicken soup from leftover rotisserie chicken
- Strange casserole-esque mixture of tuna, bacon, eggs, broccoli, carrots
- Baked potato (actually microwaved) with tuna salad and scallions

I was craving canned tuna last week, so I went ahead and bought some cans at Costco. I'm excited to find other ways to repurpose it. In college I often prepared canned tuna for myself, so it was nostalgic to be eating it again.
