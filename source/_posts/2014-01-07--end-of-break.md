I had to work the last few days I was home, unfortunately. However, when I wasn't working I had a relaxing time.

- Shopping with Mom and Jen at the Mission Viejo mall. I got two flannel shirts.
- Souplantation for dinner on Thursday.
- Basketball at Gallup on Friday afternoon.
- Jen and I made chili for lunch on Saturday.

On Sunday, during the drive up, we stopped at In-N-Out again. I like adding pickles to my burger now. I caught the end of the 49ers playoff game at Jen's place when we got back.

Last night for dinner, I hard-boiled the salted eggs that I had placed in a brine before I left for break. They were good. I also made pork chops, carrots, and bok choy.
