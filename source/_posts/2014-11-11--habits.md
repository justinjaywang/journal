A little over a year ago, I [wrote](/2013/justin-time/) about 30 day challenges and forming new habits. Of the ones I listed, here are the ones that have stuck:

- Scottish showers.
- Pushups, every day. In the morning before breakfast, I try to fit in 70 in under two minutes.
- Regular walks.
- Being honest, with myself and with others. I'm still working on this one, but I'm making strides.

Other habits I've cultivated in the last year:

- Documenting my learnings, all the time. Whether it's telling myself how to better deal with a given situation or just an interesting thing I've read, I quickly note it in my phone or computer. As a result, I've compiled comprehensive lists of each month's learnings since March.
- [Waking up early](/2014/waking-up-early/).
- Exercising daily, including [running](/2014/running/).

Habits I want to cultivate in the future:

- Eat less meat. And mostly homemade.
- Wake up even earlier.
- Write more often.
- Lead a simpler life. Want fewer things, and focus only on what's important to me.
