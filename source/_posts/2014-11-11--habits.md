A little over a year ago, I wrote about [forming new habits](/2013/justin-time/). Here are some that have stuck:

- Regular walks.
- Pushups every day, in the morning before breakfast.
- Documenting my learnings from experiences, thoughts, readings.
- [Waking up early](/2014/waking-up-early/).
- Scottish showers.

Some habits I'd like to cultivate in the future:

- Eat less meat, mostly homemade, and mindfully.
- Write more often.
- Lead a simpler life. Want fewer things, and focus only on what's important to me.
