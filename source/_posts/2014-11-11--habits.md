A little over a year ago, I [wrote](/2013/justin-time/) about 30 day challenges and forming new habits. Of the ones I listed, here are the ones that have stuck:

- Scottish showers.
- Pushups, every day. In the morning before breakfast, I try to fit in 70 in under two minutes.
- Regular walks.
- Being honest, with myself and with others. I'm still working on this one, but making great strides.

Other habits I've cultivated in the last year:

- Documenting learnings, from my experiences, thoughts, readings, etc. I have lists from each month dating back to March.
- [Waking up early](/2014/waking-up-early/).
- Exercising daily, including [running](/2014/running/).

Habits I want to cultivate in the future:

- Eat less meat, mostly homemade, and mindfully.
- Write more often.
- Lead a simpler life. Want fewer things, and focus only on what's important to me.
