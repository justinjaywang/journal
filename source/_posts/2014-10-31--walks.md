During my last week in the Bay, I was going on a lot of walks to the Berkeley Aquatic Park (just a few minutes from my apartment). I was reading [Zen Habits](http://zenhabits.net/archives/), which talks about finding simplicity in our lives. And, I was cooking a lot of what I had left over, including a risotto, of sorts, with brown rice and chicken stock.

On Saturday, I had Koryo for dinner with Akina and played board games afterwards at Theresa's house with Jason, Irena, and some of their friends. On Tuesday, I loaded up the car during the day and watched opening night of the NBA at Brendan's during the evening. I left early the next morning for home.
