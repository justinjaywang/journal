We left on a Thursday night for Taiwan. The flight was late at night, so Brendan and I still had time to play basketball with the guys after work.

Dad met us at the airport in Taipei when we landed, and Uncle Jian-Zhong drove the four of us down to Yizhu to see Grandma. We stopped in Hsinchu for breakfast and to see Dad's old college. When we got to Yizhu, we ate at a seafood restaurant for lunch and for dinner, Grandma prepared a feast.

Still jetlagged, I woke up very early in the morning to go running at the local elementary school track with Dad. I had fan tuan and gua bao for breakfast and Grandma took us to the market. We roadtripped to a temple, another temple, Kenting, and Kaohsiung. Beef noodle soup for lunch and lu rou fan for dinner.

The next day, I ran again in the morning and we left to go back up to Taipei, stopping at the Guanziling muddy hot springs. Once in Taipei, we checked into our hostel in Shilin and then had dinner with Uncle and his girlfriend.

After running and breakfast (fan tuan and mi jiang again), Brendan, Jennifer, and I went to the art museum, got Din Tai Fung for lunch, and wandered the underground malls to avoid the heat. We walked to the Shilin night market for dinner. The next day we had breakfast at Yonghe and bussed to the National Palace Museum; we went to the night market again for dinner.
