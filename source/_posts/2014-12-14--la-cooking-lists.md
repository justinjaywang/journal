Mom and I visited LA on Sunday. We took the Metrolink to Union Station, which is near downtown, and explored the area on foot for the afternoon — Chinatown, Walt Disney concert hall, Grand Central Market.

I've been enjoying cooking more than ever. In the last couple weeks, I've made beets (roasted), chicken soup, stir-fried shiitake mushrooms, Brussels sprouts (both sautéed and roasted), *lu rou fan*, coleslaw, and beef short rib stew.

I finished another personal project, too, called [Lists](http://lists.justinjaywang.com/). As of today, I've been at work starting a new one.
