I've been so busy the last few months I haven't put in a word about my apartment. 

My room is set up just the way I want, with minimal furnishings and adornment. I've been taking advantage of the amenities, too: just this morning, I went to the gym; I've been playing ping pong with my roommate Andrew during weeknights; and I'm about to go to the clubhouse to watch some basketball.
