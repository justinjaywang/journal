Spent the long July 4th weekend down in Southern California.

On Thursday, Akina came down and we spent the afternoon at Salt Creek beach. I made ribs for dinner, and afterwards we walked down the street to see the fireworks.

We drove down to San Diego the next morning and went to the famed [Phil's BBQ](http://www.philsbbq.net/), the zoo, and then [Lucha Libre](http://tacosmackdown.com/) of Man v. Food fame. The next day we hung out at the hotel, went swimming, and drove back to catch a late lunch with Randy, Nasir, and Brian at [Gen Korean BBQ](http://genkoreanbbq.com/).

Sunday we took it easy; Mom, Akina, and I grabbed brunch at Souplantation and we went grocery shopping afterwards.
