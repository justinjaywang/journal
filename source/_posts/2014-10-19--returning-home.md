After seven years, I'm finally returning home. I'll be moving out of my place in Emeryville towards the end of the month to live at homeâ€”at least for November and December, while I figure out what's next.

A change of scenery will be nice. And moving back to the place where I grew up will be even nicer. I'm a much different person than I was when I first left for school, for sure. But some things are still the same. I hope that by looking for inspiration in my past, I can learn what it is that I want in the future.

Goals for the upcoming months:

- Cook simple, healthy meals
- Get plenty of sun and exercise
- See friends
- Spend time with Mom
- Do great work
- Work tirelessly to improve my skills
