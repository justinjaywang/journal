*March 11–13* (LAX→TPE→CTU): During travel, I chatted with Randy, and then mostly listened to music (Sigur Rós, Real Estate) on the flights. We also had a layover in Taipei for number of hours, so we bussed to Taoyuan and got breakfast.

*March 13–15* (First weekend in Chengdu): Robert and Jie Jie showed us around the city—Kuanzhaixiangzi, the Jinsha Ruins, Wuhou Shrine, Jinli, Chunxi Road. This, in addition to eating some pretty great food.

*March 16–18* (Jiuzhaigou Valley): Randy's uncle booked a tour to Jiuzhaigou Valley for us. First day was getting there, second day was at the park, and third day was getting back.

*March 19–20* (Back in Chengdu): We hit up some other sights such as Du Fu's Cottage. And, of course, the pandas. At the Panda Research Base, we watched pandas eat bamboo nonstop and then ate bamboo ourselves, at a restaurant where every dish had bamboo of some sort. We also went out to an expat bar, ate surprisingly good burgers, and shot pool.

*March 21–22* (Mount Qingcheng): Retreat with Robert's co-workers. Late Saturday afternoon, we took the train over; that night, we got dinner and then relaxed in the hot springs. The next day was the hike.

*March 22–23* (CTU→TPE): Arrived back from retreat and got dinner. The following day, we hung out, got food, then left for the airport.
