*March 11–13* (Getting there): During travel, I chatted with Randy, listened to music (Sigur Rós, Real Estate, Youth Lagoon), read Paul Graham essays, and slept. There was a long layover in Taipei, so we bussed to Taoyuan and got breakfast.

*March 13–15* (First weekend in Chengdu): Robert and Jie Jie showed us around the city (Kuanzhaixiangzi, Jinsha Ruins, Wuhou Shrine, Jinli Old Street, Chunxi Road) during these two days. We also ate well (spicy hot pot, dinner by the river, banquet lunch with Randy's relatives) and generally just hung out (bookstore, Helen's bar).

*March 16–18* (Jiuzhaigou): Randy's uncle had booked a local Jiuzhaigou tour for us. It took almost a full day just to get there, but was definitely worth it.

*March 19–20* (Back in Chengdu): Thursday, Randy and I explored the city on our own during the day (Du Fu's Thatched Cottage, People's Park, Tianfu Square). Friday, the four of us watched pandas eat bamboo at the Research Base for Giant Panda Breeding. That night, we played pool at a local expat bar.

*March 21–22* (Weekend retreat): On Saturday, we took the train to Mount Qingcheng for a retreat with some of Robert's co-workers. That night, we all got dinner and then relaxed in the hot springs. The next morning, we hiked. We arrived back in Chengdu in the evening, in time for dinner.
