Food was the main theme. I had originally planned on stopping by Taipei for a just few days on the way back to America from Chengdu, but I suggested that Mom come and spend time with me there, where we could bond over food—eat some of our favorite dishes, try new ones, and get inspired.

The food I had in Chengdu was incredible, but Taiwanese cuisine is still my absolute favorite. It's comfort food, after all. This time around, I especially enjoyed Pacific saury—I prefer fried, and eaten whole (including the head and bittersweet-tasting innards) over rice. I also discovered the joys guava eaten out-of-hand. The inner portion, where the seeds are, is the best part—sweet, pungent, slimy, and just slightly salty. The rest of the favorite things I ate:

- pork bone soup, with daikon (or winter melon)
- smoked and marinated fish
- ke jia xiao chao (Hakka stir-fry)
- anchovies and peanuts
- salted egg-battered king oyster mushroom
- marinated king oyster mushroom
- dry-fried green beans
- braised pork
- lu rou fan
- braised tofu
- beef pancake roll
- bamboo
- fried tofu skin
- red bean steamed bun
- red bean whole wheat bread
- sesame ball

- Art movements are cyclical. I thought about this in Chengdu and again in Taipei at the National Palace Museum. The contrasting styles of painting in Western art (three-dimensional techniques of shadow and volume) and Eastern art (flat) centuries ago reminds me of the debate going on today over skeuomorphic versus flat interface aesthetics.
- value of printed material. longer-lasting than ephemeral writing of today

- visited Eslite bookstore. logo design, branding is still my first design love. gravitate toward what I'm interested in. reminds me too, to stay inspired, creatively staying inspired, creatively. I spent a lot of time at the Eslite bookstore and public library just browsing design books and cookbooks. you need to constantly stay inspired, as a designer.
- taipei is such a great city--infrastructure, things to do and see, transportation, facilities open to the public, food, culture. is it better than any city in America? might be, in my estimation. might be more possibilities that don't exist.
- with all that said, there are certain things america does better: sandwiches; individuality, less focus on credentials and status, more on what you contribute; less caring about what people think; less mosquitos; better weather
- danbomingli--lead a simple life as one's ideal. a lot of people do that here. live and work in thr same location, such as opening up a small shop or restaurant in front. not a bad way to exist.
- i noticed how happy mom was the first day. good to be in a community, with her own people. she can use the vocabulary of her language. she's perhaps smarter in Chinese than English.
- Chinese thinking rooted in Confucian thought--kind, well-mannered, honest, hard-working
- being with mom when she’s worrying about everything is a reminder of how much of a burden she can be. i can’t avoid the situation, though, like i sometimes have in the past.
- walking around with mosquito bites on my face makes me care less about my appearance. it’s liberating. i’m not here to impress people or pick up girls, anyway. it should always be that way.
- appreciate your hometown, see it through the eyes of a tourist. what you do on vacation as a tourist is likely what you do for real. sometimes there really is no place like home. more of a lesson in appreciation, in general.
- self-reflection has helped me tremendously. halfway through the vacation it has helped me assess what i can do to get more out of this vacation. needed to come up with a plan to get to eat what i want to eat. take control of your life and speak up. take active approach to life.
- staying inspired, creatively. I spent a lot of time at the Eslite bookstore and public library just browsing design books and cookbooks. you need to constantly stay inspired, as a designer.
