- [Food](/2015/taiwan-food) was a largest theme of the trip, which is why I have a separate post on the subject.
- Art movements are cyclical. I thought about this in Chengdu and again in Taipei at the National Palace Museum. The contrasting styles of painting in Western art (three-dimensional techniques of shadow and volume) and Eastern art (flat) centuries ago reminds me of the debate going on today over skeuomorphic versus flat interface aesthetics.
- value of printed material. longer-lasting than ephemeral writing of today
- visited Eslite bookstore. logo design, branding is still my first design love.
- Chinese thinking rooted in Confucian thought--kind, well-mannered, honest, hard-working
- i noticed how happy mom was the first day. good to be in a community, with her own people. she can use the vocabulary of her language. she's perhaps smarter in Chinese than English.
- danbomingli--lead a simple life as one's ideal. a lot of people do that here. live and work in thr same location, such as opening up a small shop or restaurant in front. not a bad way to exist.
- taipei is such a great city--infrastructure, things to do and see, transportation, facilities open to the public, food, culture. is it better than any city in America? might be, in my estimation
- being with mom when she’s worrying about everything is a reminder of how much of a burden she can be. i can’t avoid the situation, though, like i sometimes have in the past.
- walking around with mosquito bites on my face makes me care less about my appearance. it’s liberating. i’m not here to impress people or pick up girls, anyway. it should always be that way.
- things america does better: sandwiches; individuality, less focus on credentials and status, more on what you contribute; less caring about what people think; less mosquitos; better weather
- appreciate your hometown, see it through the eyes of a tourist. what you do on vacation as a tourist is likely what you do for real. sometimes there really is no place like home. more of a lesson in appreciation, in general.
- self-reflection has helped me tremendously. halfway through the vacation it has helped me assess what i can do to get more out of this vacation. needed to come up with a plan to get to eat what i want to eat. take control of your life and speak up. take active approach to life.
- staying inspired, creatively. I spent a lot of time at the Eslite bookstore and public library just browsing design books and cookbooks. you need to constantly stay inspired, as a designer.
- the food here is really good. it’s comfort food, for me. and I found my new favorite dish: Pacific saury with rice *bian dang*. I love to eat the whole thing, including head, tail, and innards (which are magnificently bitter). I’ve also been trying new breads (peanut butter bread, walnut raisin cake) and other sweets (sweet red bean, green bean, peanut, barley, hot herbal grassy jelly, fried sesame ball).
