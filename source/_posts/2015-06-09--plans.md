After I got back from Asia, my plan was to find a job that I liked and then work for a few years. I could get more experience, meet new people, and build up my network and portfolio so that one day I'd have the freedom to pursue freelancing.

The thing is, I'm just not sure if there's a job out there that I would like. At least, not a conventional job. Why invest the time and energy into finding out? Why not bypass a step, and start freelancing now? Things change quickly, and if you start down one road you might find that the dream of "one day" might never come. I'm making sure that it does come, and sooner, rather than later.

I really don't need any more experienceâ€”I learned plenty during my time at Vertigo. Anything else, I can learn as I go. The faster I can start making mistakes, the faster I can learn from them. As far as meeting people and growing my network, there are professional organizations and meetups I can join. I'm betting on myself, and trusting that if you do good work, people will notice.
