At 26, I took a chance on myself and moved to a new city.

It was never easy, but I learned the benefit of doing things that aren't always comfortable.

I continued to simplify my life by focusing on what's important to me.

I was more honest with myself. I'd like to be more honest with others.

At 27, I'm in a good place. I've figured out, for the most part, what it is I want. All that's left is to go and get it.
