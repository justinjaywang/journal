At 26, I took a chance on myself and moved to a new city. It wasn't easy, but I learned the benefit of sometimes doing uncomfortable things.

I continued to simplify my life by focusing only on what's important to me. Maybe I can be too strict at times, though.

I was more honest with myself. I'd still like to be more honest with others.

Now at 27, I'm in a good position. I've figured out, for the most part, what I want. All that's left is to go and get it.
