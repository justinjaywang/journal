Jen and Brendan's wedding was a couple weekends ago, during the Mid-Autumn festival.

My flight arrived in San Francisco on Thursday afternoon. I met Dad in Berkeley first, then we stopped for some Vietnamese bún before BARTing to the city to find him a suit for the wedding.

The next morning, we walked over to Hotel Durant. When Jen and Brendan arrived, I helped unload stuff and then made a Costco run with Brendan, his dad, and Mike. For lunch, I had dry-fried green beans over rice at the Asian Ghetto. In the evening, we had rehearsal at the stadium and then dinner with family and friends at Angeline's.

Saturday was filled with helping for the wedding, pictures for the wedding, the wedding itself, and more helping for the wedding. I ate leftover jambalaya from Angeline's in the morning, then leftover baby back ribs for lunch. The venue was beautiful, the ceremony and reception went smoothly, and everyone seemed to have a good time.

I saw Jason early the next morning; we drove to a diner on 4th Street for breakfast and then chatted for a bit afterwards. Back at the hotel, I helped load up the remaining items as people checked out and went their separate ways. After lunch at Long Life Vegi house in downtown Berkeley with Mom and Dad, I traveled with Mom down to Jen's place in San Jose. We ate at a Taiwanese restaurant for dinner, then dropped Mom off at the airport. I stayed over at Jen and Brendan's that night. We hung out, just like old times, and I met the newest member of the family, their dog Zucchi.

The next day, the three of us drove to Berkeley to meet Dad for lunch at Turkish Kitchen. I walked with Dad around campus in the afternoon; in the evening, I had bún again with Dad and then headed to the airport.
