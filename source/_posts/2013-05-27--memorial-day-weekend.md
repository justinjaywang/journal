Went home for the long weekend to visit Mom and some friends. Highlights:

- Woke up early on Saturday and went to the park with Mom.
- Played on the classical guitar for a while.
- Hometown Buffet for lunch later that day.
- Tossing the football around at Nasir's, then [streetball](http://instagram.com/p/Z1my1_TRiS/) at LHHS afterwards.
- Visit to the [Army Navy store](http://www.orangearmynavy.com/) in Orange with the crew on Sunday. I got a "tactical" toiletry bag, which should come in handy on trips.
- Basketball at Gallup with the usual gang.
- Chicken from El Pollo Loco for dinner Sunday.
- Souplantation for lunch today.
- Cooked a bunch of food to leave for Mom.
- Naps.
