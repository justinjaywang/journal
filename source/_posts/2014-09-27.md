I left Vertigo. Yesterday was my last day. I had been giving this matter a lot of thought, for a while now. I know it's the right decision.

I learned a lot from the people I worked with and interacted with during the just-under two years there. I was fortunate to have such a first full-time job. At the same time, I had sensed that my growth and learning were stagnating and that it was time to move on. 

Vertigo was an important chapter in my life; for now, though, on to the next one. At this point in my life, I'm ready take a chance and bet on myself. That I can learn every minute of every day. That I can pursue ideas that I think can positively affect the world. That I can be fulfilled in my work.

I feel extremely liberated. Also a little scared, but in a good way. It's like you're jumping into icy cold water. Daunting at first, but how exhilarating the adrenaline rush is! You feel alive for the first time in a long time.
