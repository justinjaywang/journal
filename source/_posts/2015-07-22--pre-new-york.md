- ordered a new MacBook Pro to replace my old one of five years, which had gotten way too slow; took a few days to get the new one set up just how I like it
- got new all-black Vans; they'll be my New York shoes
- SW Seafood in Irvine with Mom, Uncle Ray, Aunt Jenny, Alex, and Wei; it was a going-away dinner, of sorts, for me and Alex, who's going to New Orleans next month for school
- bought and installed a new printer for Mom
- Souplantation for dinner with Josh, Joyce, Randy, Youmi, and Leah; drinks and hanging out at Youmi's afterwards
- laundry, packing, and apartment hunting
