I went out for dinner on Monday night with Nina, Paul, and Paul's housemate Tiffany. We were originally planning to go to a place in Oakland's Chinatown, but it was closed so we ended up at Jong Ga House. I ordered fried flatfish, which was excellent paired with banchan and rice.

The work week was fine. We're now really in the last stages of the project before the deadline. Just have to push through to the end.

To celebrate the end of the week, I had Brendan and Jen over for pot roast on Friday night. Earlier in the week, I had also made chicken with almond sesame sauce and Persian cucumber, using rotisserie chicken breast and leftover almond butter.

I've started to document the process of making some of my projects (namely llllyrics and BPM), in an effort to update my portfolio of work. I had the idea to use [Medium](https://medium.com/) to write the story of the project and am currently writing and editing.

Today, I went over to Jen's to play some tennis, eat oxtail soup she made, and watch football.
