I'm continuing to learn and get work done. I accomplished my goal of finishing the prototype for the project at the end of last week.

Over the weekend, I read Google's [Material Design](http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html) guidelines. It had some interesting stuff, and I always enjoy thinking holistically about digital interfaces. It keeps me inspired. I also went through some of my bookmarked Medium articles.

This week, I updated and themed my [Tumblr blog](http://justinjaywang.tumblr.com/) and moved my journal from Scriptogram to a [Hexo](http://hexo.io/)-generated static site hosted on GitHub pages. For it, I created a custom theme called [Monk](https://github.com/justinjaywang/monk); this new journal utilizes a lot of the technology I enjoy learning about.

When I haven't been working, I've been exercising, cooking, or watching the baseball playoffs.

On Sunday, I drove to Marin to play and watch live tennis at the [Tiburon Challenger](http://tiburonchallenger.com/) with my former co-worker, Bee. After basketball on Thursday evening, I invited Jen and Brendan over for dinner. I made lu rou fan with fried tofu, preserved turnip omelette, and cabbage.

Lately, I've been cooking a lot with freezer and pantry ingredients so I can use them up before I move back to SoCal. Just like in *Chopped*, the constraints with which I had to work forced me to be creative with what dishes I made. My favorites were (1) tuna fried rice with a frozen vegetable mix of green beans, corn, peas, and carrots and (2) an anchovy and chive tomato sauce that I ate over rice.
