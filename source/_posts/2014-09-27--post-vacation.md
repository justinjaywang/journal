I had jet lag for several days once I got back. Twice, I went down for a nap, but didn't wake up until six hours later. In the time I was awake, I had lunch with Akina in Berkeley on Saturday. Sunday, I played tennis with Brendan and Jennifer at their place.

The following week at work, I had a couple of goodbye lunches: (1) the pho place next to 99 Ranch with Cheryl, Carlene, Vandy, Matt, and Ian and (2) Bowl'd with Andrew. Bee and I also played tennis on Tuesday and Friday.

Jen, Brendan, and I went to the A's game Monday night. Didi's birthday was on Wednesday; she celebrated with a dinner party at [Dan Sung Sa](http://www.yelp.com/biz/dan-sung-sa-oakland) in Oakland where I met a lot of her friends. The following night, after basketball, I met up with Sohail and Isabelle in Lower Haight for trivia night at [Mad Dog in the Fog](http://www.yelp.com/biz/mad-dog-in-the-fog-san-francisco).
