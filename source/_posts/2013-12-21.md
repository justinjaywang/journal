- Vertigo holiday party on Monday night, with catered food (pot roast). It was nice to see the office decorated and alive.
- My new ingredient of the week was daikon radish, with the most successful preparation being daikon sautéed with bacon and Brussels sprouts. I also tried roasting.
- Warriors–Spurs game on Thursday with Jen and Brendan. The Warriors lost, but it was a good game.
- Work project is getting down to the wire, so I won't be taking off any more days than is mandated. On the plus side, we did receive a [Jambox](https://jawbone.com/speakers/jambox) as a gift at work.
- Jen and I drove down earlier today, and utilized my new gift.
