This past weekend was a long one, thanks to the Presidents' Day holiday on Monday. I was hoping to make good progress on my portfolio, but that didn't happen. I should have just resigned myself to that fact from the start and taken it easyâ€”which I did, for the most part.

- On Friday night, I was in bed by 8pm but woke up a couple hours later and watched *Lost in Translation*. 
- On Saturday, I hung out in the city: lunch at [Mission Chinese Food](http://missionchinesefood.com/sf/) and later shopping (got a custom shirt at [Taylor Stitch](http://taylorstitch.com/pages/custom)) and exploring. Later in the evening, I shot hoops with Brendan and Jen and watched some NBA All-Star festivities.
- On Sunday, I ran into my old friend Ben when I was out looking at soccer cleats. I met up with him later in the day at his new place in Oakland, which he bought a month ago and has been undertaking the ambitious project of fixing it up.
- On Monday, I made vichyssoise and had Jen and Brendan over for lunch. I took a nap in the afternoon and also played guitar for the second time is as many days.
