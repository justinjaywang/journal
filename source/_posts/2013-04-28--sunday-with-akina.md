My Sunday spent with Akina:

- In the morning, we watched *[Punch-Drunk Love](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punch_Drunk_Love)* while eating a homemade brunch. I really enjoyed the movie.
- Later in the day we went swimming at my apartment complex.
- At night we picked up Wingstop and watched the Warriors playoff game against the Nuggets.
