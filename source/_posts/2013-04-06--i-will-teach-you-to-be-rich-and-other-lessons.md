I've been reading *[I Will Teach You To Be Rich](http://www.amazon.com/Will-Teach-You-To-Rich/dp/0761147489/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1365260902&sr=8-1&keywords=i+will+teach+you+to+be+rich)* during evenings, and I've been enjoying it very much. Earlier this week, I opened up an online savings account at Barclays and a Roth IRA at Charles Schwab.

Other things learned this week:

- Don't cook on too high of heat. I keep setting the fire alarm off when I'm using my cast iron pans.
- Improving a design in response to client feedback. I had to make something "pop" more. And I think I succeeded.
