I'm back home for Thanksgiving break. I flew back with Jen on Monday night and worked from home Tuesday and Wednesday.

Jen and I worked together to prepare Thanksgiving dinner. I took care of the turkey and roasted veggies, while she made the gravy, cranberry sauce, mashed potatoes, and pecan and sweet potato pies.

I saw Randy and Nasir for Souplantation on Saturday; Alisha met up with us later in the afternoon at Randy's. That night, the family had dinner at the Chinese seafood restaurant by 99 Ranch.
