Food was the main theme. I had originally planned on stopping by Taipei for a just few days on the way back to America from Chengdu, but I suggested that Mom come and spend time with me there, where we could bond over food—eat some of our favorite dishes, try new ones, and get inspired.

Chengdu food was incredible, but Taiwanese is still my absolute favorite. It's comfort food, after all. This time around, I especially enjoyed Pacific saury—I prefer fried, and eaten whole (including the head and bittersweet-tasting innards)—over rice. I also discovered the joys of eating guava out-of-hand. The inner portion, where the seeds are, is the best part—sweet, pungent, slimy, and slightly salty, in a good way. The rest of the favorite things I ate:

- king oyster mushroom
- stinky tofu, with pao cai
- lu wei, like dried tofu
- gobo root
- lotus root
- anchovies and peanuts
- beef pancake roll
- pork bone soup with winter melon
- fried gluten and peanuts
- pickled daikon
- steamed bun with red bean filling
- ke jia xiao chao (Hakka stir-fry)
- tofu skin roll

I did have some non-food thoughts, but I'll save those for their own journal entry.
