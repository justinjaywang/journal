Things I've been into this week:

- Taking walks in the evenings, to Bay Street or Trader Joe's
- Shooting hoops during lunch
- Baked potatoes, chives, and sardines
- Costco super extra-large peanuts

On Friday, I went to the Emeryville Art Exhibition with Jen and then came over later that night for dinner and *Modern Family*. On Saturday, I played soccer with Brendan and then met up with Patrick near campus to catch up.
