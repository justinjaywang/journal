I spent the holidays back home in Orange County. It was nice and relaxing.

I flew back on Christmas Eve, and read *The Shape of Design* by Frank Chimero. Jen and Mom picked me up when I arrived and then we ate dumplings for dinner. On Christmas Day, we watched the Warriorsâ€“Cavs game while preparing food for dinner later at the Wanninger's.

After lunch the next day, Jen and I went shopping and Brendan visited. We had planned to play basketball, but it was too windy so we hung out and watched a Harry Potter marathon on TV instead. I made a dinner of tomato eggs, string beans with minced pork, and pan-fried tofu.

On Sunday, I played tennis with Josh at the high school and then made lunch. Dinner that night at Uncle Ray's. The next few days, I mostly hung out at home, cooking meals for myself and Mom, going on walks, and working on projects.

On New Year's Day, I drove up to LA to visit Byron. We spent the day exploring the city with Amy and Vanessa. Highlights included the Griffith Observatory, and dinner and bowling in Koreatown.

I spent the remainder of the weekend relaxing (such as re-watching *Garden State*) before working remotely the last week I was home. On my last night, I got dinner with Randy, Josh, Joyce, and Brian at Souplantation (Randy and Brian had just got back from their Asia trip). We hung out at Youmi's afterwards.
