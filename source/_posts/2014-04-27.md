Monday night, I met Cole and Zahin at [Grand Oaks](http://www.grandoaksrestaurant.com/) to watch the Warriors–Clippers playoff game and eat some fish and chips.

Tuesday night, I met Kliulai and her friend Brian at nearby [Black Diamond Cafe](http://www.blackdiamondcafe.com/) to discuss a project idea they had. By Thursday, I had given it some thought and told them I was in.

Wednesday night, Brendan and I played pickup soccer in Berkeley. I scored a number of goals on hard cuts to the goal.

Thursday night, I played basketball after work and then headed over to the Mission to meet with Brian and Kliulai to start working on our project, codenamed *Elsa*.

Friday night, I was exhausted after work, so I ate, then took a quick nap, then watched the Rockets–Trail Blazers game while working on the new project.

Saturday night, Brendan invited friends over to their place for a surprise potluck to celebrate Jen's dissertation submittal. I made Brussels sprouts with bacon and caramelized onions.

Today, I went over to Cole's place in Grand Lake to watch the Warriors game with him and Felicia. The three of us ate at [Jong Ga House](http://www.yelp.com/biz/jong-ga-house-oakland) afterwards. In the evening, I played basketball with Paul and Thomas at Bushrod Park.
