During my last week in the Bay, I was going on a lot of walks (and sometimes runs) along the Berkeley Aquatic Park, which is just a few minutes from my apartment. I was inspired by reading [Zen Habits](http://zenhabits.net/archives/), which talks about finding simplicity in our lives. For meals, I was cooking a lot of what I had left over, including a risotto of sorts, with brown rice and chicken stock.

On Saturday, I had Koryo for dinner with Akina and played board games afterwards at Theresa's house with Jason, Irena, and some of their friends. On Tuesday, I loaded up the car with my belongings during the day and watched opening night of the NBA at Brendan's during the evening. Early the next morning, I left for home.
