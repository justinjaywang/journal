Returned yesterday from a family vacation that Jen and I planned. We stayed at a hotel in downtown Palm Springs for three nights and explored nature at Joshua Tree National Park for two of the days.

**Day 1:** We left for Palm Springs in the late morning. When we arrived, we ate [sandwiches](http://sandwichspotpalmsprings.com/) for lunch, walked to the pharmacy to get sunblock (I also picked up a hat and sandals), and then spent the afternoon swimming and relaxing by the pool. Dinner at [Lulu](https://www.lulupalmsprings.com/).

**Day 2:** I woke up early and read. Later, I went with Mom and Jen to Sherman's for breakfast, where I got Beef 'n Latkes—corned beef in between two latkes, served with pickles. We spent the day in Joshua Tree National Park, and didn't get back until dark. For dinner, we had pho at the hotel restaurant.

**Day 3:** In the morning, I lifted weights at the fitness center; Jen swam, and Dad did exercises on the stationary bike. The family went to [L'Atelier Cafe](http://www.latelier-cafe.com/) for breakfast. Jen and I left for Joshua Tree to hike while Mom and Dad stayed in Palm Springs to relax. The hike we had planned to do was closed, so we ended up doing a backcountry hike at [Porcupine Wash](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Porcupine+Wash/@33.8209073,-115.7863661,5580m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m2!3m1!1s0x80da872d6a497a79:0xb8c0358c19404ec1) that lasted several hours. We were glad to relax at the hotel jacuzzi once we got back in the evening. That night, the family went to [Fisherman's Market & Grill](https://www.fishermans.com/palmsprings.php) for dinner.

**Day 4:** Mom, Dad, and I spent the early morning at the fitness center while Jen did some laps at the pool again. Breakfast at [Peabody's](http://www.peabodyscafepalmsprings.com/) before we checked out and drove home. On the way, we stopped by [Desert Hills](http://www.premiumoutlets.com/outlets/outlet.asp?id=6) and did some outlet shopping. We arrived home in the afternoon and went to Costco to pick up some groceries for dinner. I cooked salmon marinated in soy sauce, brown sugar, and garlic, and Mom and Jen helped make Caesar salad and stir-fried lotus root.
