I had a great weekend; Mom and Dad visited.

On Saturday, we went out to a late lunch, and later that evening we played ping pong while watching college basketball and I cooked dinner for them.

On Sunday, Akina joined us for lunch. After the parents flew back in the afternoon, Akina and I hung out and had a belated birthday dinner at [Sura](http://www.yelp.com/biz/sura-oakland), a Korean barbecue joint in Oakland.
