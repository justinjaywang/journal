I've just about finished buying furnishings for my place. I ordered a Japanese futon off Amazon, got half sheet pans and measuring cups from a kitchen supply store in Chinatown, and made an IKEA trip for bedding, slippers, and storage cube things. But I just couldn't find a suitable bench for my room.

The one I had at my old place in Emeryville was perfect. I used it as a low table for work and reading as well as for sitting. It was from IKEA, but it's since been discontinued. I searched for hours (if not days), both in-store and online, but nothing I found matched my taste, and at a price point I was willing to pay. As a result, I continued to use my suitcase as a desk surface to put my laptop on.

Steve Jobs famously could make buying a sofa into a decade-long ordeal. I can understand that feeling, to a certain extent. Buying furnishings was a big deal for me. And I'd argue that it should be, too, for anyone who cares about the things you surround yourself with on a daily basis. All the stuff I mentioned getting? I spent way too much time deliberating on them before actually deciding. It was a mental drain.

You can hold out, looking for perfection, but there's a cost. Speaking generally, life is lived now, in that time spent searching and holding out. Temporary solutions turn permanent. Sometimes you just have to make the best decision given your current options, rather than wait indefinitely for a better one to show up. Because it might not. You have to move on and make the most of what you have.

So, I finally bit the bullet and picked up a couple of IKEA [LACK](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/20011413/) side tables after work on Monday.
