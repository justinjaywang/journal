Since Taiwan and China, I've been at home looking for jobs, cooking, and going on walks. Earlier this month, I visited Jen and Brendan for a couple weeks at their new place in San Jose. Jen and I then flew back to Orange County together. Dad was in town for the weekend, also. Lately, I've been studying and working—I'm now pursuing freelancing, full-time.

*OC, part 1:*

- trip to Anaheim with Mom; we ate bánh mì for lunch
- cooking: nut breads; steamed buns with apple and peanut butter or with sweet potato; babkas with peanut butter; johnnycakes; matchstick potatoes with bell peppers, or carrots, or corn; lu rou; dried tofu with scallions and celery; pork belly; bok choy; daikon; egg omelettes
