Ten months ago, I started seeing a girl. She was an old friend, who I had a huge crush on in school (but she had a boyfriend at the time). It ended in heartbreak, but the experience changed my outlook on life. It made me see that, well, good things really can happen. I never thought they could happen to me, until they did. Sounds cheesy, but it's true.

At that time, I kept coming back to this thought of "Why not me?" Since then, with this motto, I've made some pretty bold decisions.

Other people have taken chances and pursued their passions. Why not me? Good things happen, if you just take action.
