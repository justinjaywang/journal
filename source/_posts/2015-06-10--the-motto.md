Ten months ago, I started seeing a girl. She was an old friend from school; I always had a crush on her but she always seemed to have a boyfriend.

Things ended in heartbreak, but the experience changed my outlook on life. It made me see that, well, good things really can happen. I never thought they could happen to me, until they did. Sounds cheesy, but it's true.

At that time, I kept coming back to this thought of "Why not me?" Since then, I've made some bold decisions with this motto in mind. Other people have taken chances and pursued their passions. Why not me? Good things can happen, if you take action.
