I've been keeping somewhat busy and continuing to go with the flow. Overall, I like the direction I'm headed. This week also happened to be my one year anniversary at Vertigo.

- Warriors game on Monday night with Brendan and Jen.
- I made Malaysian chicken curry and ate that the first few days of the week. Later in the week, I made a recipe of my own creation—a soup—using leftover rotisserie chicken carcass and coconut milk as a flavor base, with green beans, shiitake mushrooms, red dates, and star anise. I also mixed in a little soy sauce and topped it off with fried shallots and black pepper.
- I hung out with Akina on Wednesday night.
- Basketball game on Thursday at lunch. Our team was undefeated.
- Friday, Tony took me out to [Tacubaya](http://www.tacubaya.net/) in Berkeley, for a sort of an anniversary lunch. We had a good, honest talk about Vertigo and design.
- Yesterday, I went to work early and stayed a little later since it's crunch time for our project. After work, I just hung out at home, watching Jeopardy with my roommates.
- Saturday, I got up early and worked on my portfolio. For lunch, I met up with Nina in Berkeley at [Great China](http://greatchinaberkeley.com/). The mei cai kou rou was delicious, and is something I'd like to try making. Later, I had afternoon tea with Brittany at [Asha Tea House](http://www.ashateahouse.com/).
- I had pleasant experiences at both locations. The food and tea were excellent, and I had good talks with the people I was with.
- Today, I played tennis and afterwards had Jen and Brendan over to eat some cassoulet (or a version of it) that I made, with northern white beans, sausage, bacon, and chicken thighs.
