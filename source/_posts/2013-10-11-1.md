As it turns out, I decided not to go out to Missouri Lounge with Nina, Paul, and Phoebe after work. Fridays nights are sacred; they're Justin time. No offense, but I feel like I could be doing something more productive. This trend dates back to my college days, when I almost always regretted going to parties and would have rather have spent the time improving my skills, such as playing guitar. I think I'm just different in this way.

I love nights where I'm feeling inspired and my mind is swimming. Tonight is one of those nights. It started with the question “Who do I want to be in five years?” and the realization that I need to be more disciplined to achieve my vision. I can't lose sight of who I am and who I want to be. So I sent an email to myself, 5 years in [the future](http://www.futureme.org/) as a checkpoint.

I also came across ideas for [challenges](http://www.stumbleupon.com/su/1GDCAp/:1uZG5T2Sq:qTeKzgqt/www.highexistence.com/30-challenges-for-30-days/) that was inspired by Matt Cutt's [TED talk](http://www.ted.com/talks/matt_cutts_try_something_new_for_30_days.html) about trying something new for 30 days. 

If there's something I'd like to change about myself or I just want to form a good habit, nothing's stopping me. So I might as well do it as soon as possible. These are the challenges I chose:

- Take a walk each day. I can easily accomplish this by walking into town on work days, or in the evenings to Trader Joe's.
- Take a cold shower each day. Or when I do take a shower, make it a [Scottish shower](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shower#Scottish_shower). Acccording to many sources they have real [health benefits](http://www.artofmanliness.com/2010/01/18/the-james-bond-shower-a-shot-of-cold-water-for-health-and-vitality/).
- Keep a dream journal. I've been dreaming a lot lately. I briefly flirted with writing my dreams a couple years ago, but didn't keep it up.
- 100 push ups each day. I've already been doing this for the last two weeks.
- Be honest, to myself and to others.

These can start off as 30 day challenges, but can easily become lifelong habits.
