This year for Oak's annual weeklong retreat, called Oakweek, we drove to a small town called [Kerhonkson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerhonkson,_New_York), a few hours north of the city. The [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/7483065) we stayed at was well-designed and cozy.

During the week, we: went on a whiskey tour at a nearby distillery, watched movies (*Hackers* and *Ted 2*), cleaned the pool, figured out how to heat the pool, swam in the pool, hiked at [Mohonk Mountain House](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohonk_Mountain_House), took turns cooking dinner (I made braised chicken and tofu over sesame noodles with cucumber, accompanied by sautéed vegetables), grilled burgers and pizza, roasted s'mores over a campfire, made a playlist about campfires, drank [Dark ’N Stormies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_%27N%27_Stormy), and of course, worked.
