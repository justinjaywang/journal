These past couple of weeks, after the snow melted, I've been able to stretch my legs a bit more, walking to Manhattan a handful of times, including a few times to work in the morning. It's been getting colder, though. This morning, the temperature is down to single digits.

Last weekend, I read *Hello, I am Erik*, an Erik Spiekermann retrospective.

My biggest takeaway was that, more than anything, he was a gifted communicator ("You are what you say and how you say it"). Affecting that voice with which you communicate visually is what motivated his work.

> I might say that the weather doesn't interest me. However, it still influences my mood. It's the same with typography; all cultural expressions influence us. Take buildings, for example: the way they look, how they work. Even if we're ignorant about architecture, buildings still influence us a lot. The same goes for typography â€“ it influences all of us.

Skylar lent me the book, and he's been steadily giving me more each week. Along with the office book collection and the nearby Brooklyn Public Library, I feel like I have a wealth of design material to read and learn from, which is a nice feeling to have.

Other random things:

- In the cold weather, I'll just be walking and out of nowhere my nose starts to run, full-on dripping down to my mouth. I'd never really experienced that before. Kind of interesting.
- I live right across from a church, and the carillon bells ring on the hour (with an additional soft ring at the half hour). I like that. And at noon and 6pm, they play a tune. Reminds me of the Campanile back in school.
- I started making bread again: yeast breads (mostly sandwich rolls in baguette form) and flatbreads. I've also been experimenting with cold dishes, like julienned red bell pepper in olive oil, vinegar, and garlic.
