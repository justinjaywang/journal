We stayed at a hostel near Taipei 101 for the remainder of the trip.

- Pai gu fan at [君悅排骨](https://www.facebook.com/GrandHyattpaigu) (twice); it was among the best meals of the trip.
- Jen took us to the Google Taipei office on the 73rd floor of Taipei 101 for lunch with a view.
- Climbing Elephant Mountain with Brendan and Jen in the evening. I'd scale it two other times by myself at dawn to catch the sunrise.
- Eating chua bing so often at the Tonghua night market that the vendor recognized me and chatted with me. On our last night, when Jen and I ordered dou hua to go, he gave it to us on the house and told us to come back next time we're in Taiwan.
- [Spring Natural Vegetarian Restaurant](http://springfood.com.tw/) with A-Gong. It was delicious, as always.
- Beitou and Tamsui day trip with Xiao A-Yi.
- Dinner at Xiao A-Yi's for the Mid-Autumn Festival, eating lots of fruit, and putting pomelo rind on our heads.
- Hiking at Neidong near a waterfall with Uncle and his girlfriend.
- Shenkeng old street with Xiao A-Yi and her friend and his family. We ate stinky tofu, among other things.
- Self-serve lunch places, where you can pick which dishes and how much. I've always loved them.
- The Confucius Temple, where I learned about calligraphy and archery.
- Riding YouBikes along the river.
