Shit. I feel old, but I know I shouldn't. After all, I'm only going to get older.

25 was a transition year. Above all else, I gained greater self-awareness through continual and active reflection. I came to realize what the most important things to me are—what I value most—and made changes in my life which reflect these priorities.

I gave myself time and space to refocus. And I made a list, [*Rules for Living*](/2015/rules-for-living).

I spent time traveling to get invaluable perspective.

I built up habits for a healthy lifestyle—eating well, staying active.

I got better at cooking, by getting a lot of practice.

I learned to appreciate. Much more than I have in the past.

26, I hope, will be another landmark year—of refocusing, of simplifying, of letting myself be happy, of learning to love.
