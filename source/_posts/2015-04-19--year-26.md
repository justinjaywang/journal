Shit. I feel old, but I know I shouldn't. After all, I'm only gonna get older.

25 was a transition year. Above all else, I gained more self-awareness. I came to realize what things I value most and made changes in my life which reflect these priorities.

I gave myself time and space to refocus.

I spent time traveling to get invaluable perspective.

I built up habits for a healthy lifestyle—eating well, staying active.

I got better at cooking, by getting a lot of practice.

I learned to appreciate. Much more than I have in the past.

26, I hope, will be another landmark year—of refocusing, of simplifying, of loving others and myself.
