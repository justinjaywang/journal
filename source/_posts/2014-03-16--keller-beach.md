The project at work is going well so far. Glad to be working in web again. I also discovered a small beach in Point Richmond, on the other side of the tunnel that recently opened up again. It's about a 15 minute walk from the office, so I can head there from time to time to get away.

I've been reading a lot this past week, in the morning before work and in the evenings. I finished *[The Sports Gene](http://www.amazon.com/The-Sports-Gene-Extraordinary-Performance/dp/1591845114)*, a handful of [Medium](https://medium.com/) posts by [Julie Zhuo](https://medium.com/@joulee), articles on [Wait But Why](http://waitbutwhy.com/), and am currently working through some [essays](http://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html) by Paul Graham.

Other highlights:

- Soccer on Wednesday
- Basketball on Thursday
- Swimming, oxtail soup for dinner, and *The Lego Movie* on Saturday
- Bowling for Jason's birthday on Sunday
