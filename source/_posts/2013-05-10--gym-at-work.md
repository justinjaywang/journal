I started a new project at work this week. And during evenings this week, I finished up a personal project, a website called [llllyrics](http://llllyrics.com/). Other things of note:

- Going to the gym during lunch to do some cycling and lifting is a nice break from sitting around all day.
- Played tennis with Bee at lunch on Thursday. First time I played in a while.
- Akina and I have been into watching *Modern Family* this week.
