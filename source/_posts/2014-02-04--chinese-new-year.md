Jen and I spent the weekend down in SoCal with Mom. When I wasn't working, I was shooting hoops at the park, shopping, or cooking and eating.

Mom had gotten rotisserie chicken quarters from Costco, so I experimented with adding kumquats and roasting it with the chicken. On Sunday, we went to Souplantation for brunch. For the Super Bowl, I made guacamole and Jen made chili, fries, and sweet potato pizza.
