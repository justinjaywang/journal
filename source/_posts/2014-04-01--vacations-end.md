I spent the rest of vacation playing ball at the park, watching *Modern Family* with mine, hanging out with friends (picking up Randy and Brian from the border and lunch at [I-Tea Cafe](http://www.yelp.com/biz/i-tea-cafe-irvine)), reading (finished up my Pocket queue of Paul Graham essays and *After the Quake* Murakami short stories), and cooking (roasted salmon, Malaysian curry, steak and potatoes, and Taiwanese pork cutlet rice).
