Randy and I leave for Chengdu on Wednesday. Li Lao Shi invited us over for dinner this past Thursday, and we chatted afterwards about the trip. Things I want to do while abroad:

- get perspective
- meet people
- reconnect
- clear my mind
- write
- refocus

I've also been editing, reformatting, and adding more projects to my portfolio, including a foot selfie blog I just made. My job search has been ramping up, too. For breaks, I've been walking to Jordan Market to pick up some groceries. I'm still cooking two meals every day as well.
