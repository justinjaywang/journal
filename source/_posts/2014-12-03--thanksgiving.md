Dad came home for the week and Jen for the weekend. Tuesday night, I made lu rou fan for dinner; Wednesday, stir-fried shrimp. On Thanksgiving day, Jen, Mom, and I prepared mashed potatoes, roasted root vegetables, Brussels sprouts with a soy-orange glaze, roasted chicken, and pecan pie.

The rest of the weekend:

- Friday night, I hung out for a bit with Brian and Nasir
- Saturday, lunch in Orange with Brendan and his family
- Sunday night, dinner at Souplantation with the Shu Shu, Shen Shen, and Dou Dou
- Rained out from running
- Finished monograms project
