It rained a lot last weekend and the beginning of this week. It was symbolic: a cleansing, of sorts. I feel like a lot of things are in flux right now.

On Saturday, I hung out with Akina at Bay Street in the afternoon and had Great China again for dinner. Sunday, I continued working on my portfolio and went to Costco with Brendan and Jen.

At work, I've been finishing up some tasks with my previous project. I talked a few times over the week with our design director about what's next for me.

Wednesday evening was pick-up soccer in Berkeley with Brendan. Thursday for lunch was basketball (it stopped raining by then). Today for lunch, I walked to town with Paul and Nina and hit up Pikanhas Brazilian. It's been a while since we've been back.
