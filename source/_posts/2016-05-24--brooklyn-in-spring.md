Gettin’ my [priorities](/2014/most-important/) in order. I've been focusing a lot of my energy on work, and it's paying off—I feel like I'm starting to find my stride.

I'm still mostly cooking at home (asparagus; wood ear mushrooms; potato dumplings; roasted cauliflower; sweet potato; jicama, cucumber, tomato, and cilantro salad; stir-fried vegetables with doubanjiang and chili oil), but will occasionally eat out with friends on the weekend (notably: spicy pickles and ramen at [Chuko Ramen](http://barchuko.com/bar-chuko-menu/); veggie dumplings and Mapo tofu at [The Market](http://www.themarket372.info/menu/)).

I try to bring lunch every day, too, but I save it for the next day when the guys do a joint food order. Of the places we go, [Court Street Grocers](http://www.courtstreetgrocers.com/menu-csg/) has been my favorite, by far. Their "Uncle Chucky" sandwich—roasted cauliflower, pumpkin seed romesco, pickled fennel, red onion, and arugula on a seeded roll—is the best non-Asian food I've had in a long while, and probably one of the best sandwiches I've ever had. [Red Star Sandwich Shop](http://www.redstarbk.com/) is interesting too, more so for their story (a menu "inspired by the cultural and culinary experience of Asian-Americans") than their food (though their fried tofu sandwich with gochujang, daikon and dill pickles is pretty solid).

On Saturdays, I usually play ball with the crew at Classon Playground. The weather's been nice for that as of late. I look forward to it every week, and am usually dead (in a good way) for the rest of the afternoon, evening, and into Sunday. I've been staying up to watch the NBA Playoffs when I can, too, though now I get nervous watching Warriors games. I have to keep reminding myself not to get too invested.

For music, I've been listening to some old favorites—Mates of State, the Wannadies, and Julian Nation—as well as new ones—Frankie Cosmos. I also went to a couple concerts, Yuck and Frankie Cosmos, both in Williamsburg.

Lastly, a couple family and friend visits: I played tour guide for the weekend when Dad, Arni, and Jonathan came back in mid-April. Then towards the end of April, Brian moved to New York and stayed at my place for a few nights.

I've been inspired lately by Michael Bierut's monograph [*How to*](https://www.amazon.com/Graphic-Design-Things-Explain-Better/dp/0062413902), Roy Choi's memoir [*L.A. Son*](https://www.amazon.com/L-Son-Life-City/dp/0062202634), *Brain Pickings* articles on [Van Gogh](https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/12/01/van-gogh-purpose-letter/), [*Chef's Table*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chef%27s_Table), and even [*Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedians_in_Cars_Getting_Coffee). The common threads that made all these people great: hard work for a long period of time, perseverance, and dedication to your craft.
