I hate that end-of-trip feeling. 

I just got back to my place in the Bay after being back home in Orange County for a week and a half to take care of Mom (and working from home during that time). I also was able to see Akina a couple times before she leaves to study abroad in London for the fall.

Some of my SoCal activities:

- Grocery shopping with Mom
- A lot of cooking and a lot of eating (Malaysian curry with chicken, Korean BBQ short ribs, baby back ribs with fries and coleslaw, almond and coconut-crusted sole)
- Basketball at the Gallup Park with the guys
- Salt Creek beach
- *Minority Report* and *Rush Hour* marathon at home
- *Jobs* in theaters
- Souplantation brunch this morning before my flight
