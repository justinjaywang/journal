Mom and I visited LA on Sunday. We took the Metrolink to Union Station, which is near downtown, and explored the area on foot for the afternoon—Chinatown, Walt Disney concert hall, Grand Central Market.

I've been enjoying cooking more than ever. In the last couple weeks, I've made beets (roasted), chicken soup, stir-fried shiitake mushrooms, Brussels sprouts (both sautéed and roasted), lu rou fan, coleslaw, and beef short rib stew.

I finished another personal project, too, called Lists. As of today, I've been at work starting a new one.
