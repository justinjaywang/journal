The journey to the Philippines took over a full day, and involved stops in Taipei and Manila, China Airlines seafood meals, a bag of homemade trail mix, listening to music, naps, and getting moved to a later flight to Cebu—luckily, I met someone nice enough to let me use her phone to notify Dad.

**Thursday**—First night in the Philippines. Dinner at *Casa Verde* for spare ribs and roasted chicken.

**Friday**—At the office for most of the day. Volleyball in the evening. After dinner at home, Dad and I attended a company party at the [Crown Regency](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Crown+Regency+Residences+Cebu/@10.3185,123.885,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x33a99ecc616da429:0x21c897fd84fba463), where there was a bar and karaoke. I made plans with some of the employees to go out on Sunday for the [Sinulog](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinulog) festival.

**Saturday**—Trip to the Filipino Costco, called S&R, in the morning. It was interesting seeing what produce and products they had for sale. Basketball in the evening, then dumplings for dinner.

**Sunday**—Met up with my new friends in the late morning to attend the Sinulog festivities. We watched the parade from a grandstand while I tried some new foods, [kwek kwek](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokneneng) and green mango dipped in shrimp paste. Afterwards, we walked around and most of them got their faces painted. 

For dinner, we ate lechón belly with puso (hanging rice) and a glass of Coke. More wandering around after dinner. The scene was surreal. By then, the sun had gone down and the streets became the setting for one huge rave. I made it out, but not without a paint-covered face to show for it. The final stop of the night was karaoke, which was the highlight of the entire day. At midnight, we rode a jeepney back to City Lights and they walked me to the gate.

**Monday**—Walked around one of Cebu's giant malls, Ayala. Shot some hoops downstairs. For dinner, we had some more Filipino cuisine: crispy pata, mongo soup, and kare-kare.

**Tuesday**—Dad and I took a short trip to the recently-opened CallTek office in [General Santos](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Santos). Lunch at a café near the hotel, consisting of Filipino fare: tuna sisig, chicken adobo, and pinakbet. Afterwards, we scoured the malls, looking for furniture and appliances for the new office. Dinner: crab and grilled tuna belly.

**Wednesday**—In the early morning, I met some more company people over breakfast at McDonald's—they're over in GenSan training new employees. We also had dinner together, a seafood feast at Tiongson Arcade: grilled tuna jaw, tuna roe, fried calamari, lechón kawali with julienned green mango, and shrimp sinigang.

**Friday**—Ran some errands in the morning with Dad. I played volleyball again in the afternoon. I then treated to dinner the people who took care of me during Sinulog—Derek, Lance, Honey, Xyza, Asha, Angel, Nel, Bless, and Linda.

**Saturday**—Island hopping with Dad, some of his friends, and some company people. The day was spent riding on a jeepney to and from the harbor, boating from island to island (three total, I think), swimming with fish, and braving the cold weather. We ate lunch on the boat, too: rice, lumpia, marinated pork belly, kinilaw, shrimp, yams, and dried calamari.

**Sunday**—Lunch at a dim sum restaurant. Afterwards, a long nap—my body was telling me I needed to rest.

**Monday**—Travel.
