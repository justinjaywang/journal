My plan, after I got back from my trip, was to find a job that I liked and then work for a few years to get more experience and build up my network and portfolio. Then I'd have skills and resources to pursue freelancing.

The thing is, after searching for jobs for a while, I'm just not sure there's a conventional job that I would like. At least, they'd be hard to come by. But why invest the time and energy into finding out? My new plan now is to skip the "get more experience" step and just start freelancingâ€”it was my eventual goal, so I might as well start making mistakes and learning from them, sooner rather than later. Anything I need to learn I can learn as I go, I feel. As far as meeting people and growing my network, there are meetups and professional organizations, like AIGA.

I'm betting on myself, and trusting that if you do good work, people will notice.
