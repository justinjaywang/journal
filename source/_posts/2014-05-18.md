Yesterday, I went to the [Maker Faire](http://makerfaire.com/) with Kliulai and Brian to check out some of the projects. Paella for lunch, then afterwards we got [My Tofu House](http://www.yelp.com/biz/my-tofu-house-san-francisco) for dinner since we were in the neighborhood.

We stopped by Muji for inspiration then worked during the night at Kliulai's.
