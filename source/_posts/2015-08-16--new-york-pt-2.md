New York has so many options for eating out, and from every type of cuisineâ€”I've already had Middle Eastern, Mediterranean, Caribbean, Mexican, Peruvian, Chinese, Taiwanese, Japanese, Vietnamese, Cambodian, Thai, and of course, American. Still, I was glad to start cooking again when I moved into my sublet. It's cheaper, healthier, and often just tastes better.

I walked to Chinatown last weekend to shop for groceries and get some kitchen supplies. I made *lu rou* with fried tofu, along with Taiwanese cabbage, kale, carrots, and sunny side up eggs; I packed the leftovers in a rice bowl as lunch for the past week. The coming week's menu includes tomato eggs, julienned carrots, Taiwanese cabbage, braised king oyster mushrooms, and pickled mustard greens.

I'm settled into my sublet now, too. My room is huge, and even has a TV. More importantly, it has air conditioning. I really love the apartment complex. It's got plenty of walking space, trees, lawns, and basketball courts. I go for walks in the evenings, when it's nice and cool. I've shot hoops a few times here and played pickup once, though I've still been heading to Brooklyn to play on Saturday mornings.
