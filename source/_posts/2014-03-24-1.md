I think year 24 was about becoming an adult. I gained valuable real-world experience, improved my soft skills, got my finances in order, wrote in my journal, developed an iOS app, developed a web app, stayed in shape, and cooked.

As of late, I've started some good habits that I'd like to continue: noting my takeaway learnings after every situation, Scottish showers to remind me to get out of my comfort zone, waking up early to read or write or exercise, full-body free weight workouts twice a week, and eating well.

What will year 25 be about? I project it as a development year &mdash; for my career and for my relationships. Here are some goals:

- Connect with friends whose company I enjoy and value
- Open myself up to new experiences, meeting people
- More personal projects in web and mobile
- Try many new recipes
- Become a better athlete and competitor
- Take a lot of pictures
- Use writing as a way to elucidate my thoughts
