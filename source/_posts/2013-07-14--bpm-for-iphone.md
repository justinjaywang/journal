The iPhone app I've been working on has [finally arrived](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bpm-metronome/id668502976) on the App Store. It's a metronome app called BPM.

I'm very proud of the work I've done. The skills I practiced and learned over the course of the project were far-reaching. I spent a lot of the time poring over the details and I feel it paid off. 

For example, I spent days trying to get just the right "beep" sound. I knew in my head what I wanted: something that was more true to the medium and not trying to replicate the click of an analog metronome. I ended up recording a Roland TR-808 sound as a digital instrument in GarageBand and editing the clip in the audio editor, Audacity. 

And, there were a lot more stories like this throughout this project.
