I'm a perfectionist. And designing for the current project at work, I've found that the final product is beyond my control and I really struggled with that earlier in the week.

I think I'm resigned to the fact that there has to be different standards for work projects and personal projects. I'm learning a lot about things get done in the real world, and that's been a bit of a culture shock.
