I'm a perfectionist. I struggled with that at my last internship. Having to collaborate on designs, I often found a way to take control. Now, designing for the current project at work, the final product is beyond my control and I admittedly struggled with that earlier in the week. 

I think I'm resigned to the fact that there has to be different standards for work projects and personal projects. I'm learning a lot about things get done in the real world, and that's been a bit of a culture shock.
