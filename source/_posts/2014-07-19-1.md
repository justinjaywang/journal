Projects, both for work and outside of work, have kept me busy the last couple of weeks. 

Last weekend, Kliulai's brother, Yufay, was visiting San Francisco so we all hung out on Saturday (dim sum in Chinatown in the morning and work session in the afternoon) and Sunday (basketball at Mission High and Chinese for lunch while watching the World Cup final). In the evening on Saturday, I also had dinner with Jen and Brendan at Wood Tavern in Berkeley to celebrate Jen's job offer.

This past week was officially my last on my current work project. As such, I found myself motivated to work hard, even at home in the evenings, to make sure the final product is something I can stand for and be proud of (and it is).

This weekend so far, I watched *Gravity* with Jen and Brendan at their place and we booked plane tickets for our trip to Taiwan next month. Today, we went to the batting cages by the airport, ate lunch at In-N-Out, went to Sports Authority so I could get a glove, and played catch at San Pablo Park. I swam for a bit when I got back and then made dinner. I'll spend the rest of the night working on my side project.
