We left on a Thursday night for Taiwan. The flight was late at night, so Brendan and I still had time to play basketball with the guys after work.

Dad met us at the airport in Taipei when we landed, and Uncle Jian-Zhong drove the four of us down to Yizhu to see Grandma. We stopped in Hsinchu for breakfast and to see Dad's old college. When we got to Yizhu, we ate at a seafood restaurant for lunch and for dinner, A-Ma prepared a feast.

Jetlagged, I woke up very early the next morning and went running at the local elementary school track with Dad. I had fan tuan and gua bao for breakfast and Grandma took us to the market. We roadtripped to a temple, another temple, Kenting, and Kaohsiung. Beef noodle soup for lunch and lu rou fan for dinner.

The next morning, I ran again and we left to go back up to Taipei, stopping at the Guanziling muddy hot springs. Once in Taipei, we checked into our hostel in Shilin and then had dinner with Uncle and his girlfriend.

During our stay in Shilin, we:

- continued eating Taiwanese breakfasts,
- visited the [Taipei Fine Arts Museum](http://www.tfam.museum/Index.aspx?ddlLang=en-us) and the [National Palace Museum](http://www.npm.gov.tw/en/),
- ate at the famed [Din Tai Fung](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Din_Tai_Fung),
- walked the underground malls to avoid the heat,
- and wandered the Shilin night market.
