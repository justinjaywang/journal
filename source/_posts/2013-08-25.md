The work week was fine. I played basketball with Paul, who just started at Vertigo, on Wednesday and Friday at Live Oak Park. It's been a while since I shot hoops there. I also finished up the songwriting course I was taking online. Hopefully I can get some traction on the typeface project during this coming week.
