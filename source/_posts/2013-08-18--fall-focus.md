With summer essentially over, I plan to use these upcoming fall months to really focus on self-improvment.

I had my 6-month performance review earlier this month. It was helpful to take a step back and assess how I'm doing, what I'm learning, and how I can improve. The day-to-day can often make you forget to do so, but it's so important. Among my goals is to improve my visual design skills.

My upcoming projects include designing a new typeface and recording an EP.
