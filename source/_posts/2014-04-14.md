Both Paul and Nina left Vertigo this week. The three of us had dinner at [Manpuku](http://www.manpukuberkeley.com/) in Elmwood on Friday night. We toasted to “new things.”

On the plus side, I've been put back on a project that allows me to do front-end web development. I've been motivated to come in early.

Saturday was [Cal Day](http://calday.berkeley.edu/), so I hung around Berkeley for the day. I walked for a bit with Cindy and Nils, then got lunch with Akina at [KoJa Kitchen](http://www.yelp.com/biz/koja-kitchen-berkeley). Afterwards, I attended some design activities and watched the men's tennis team. Finally, I stuck around to see the band Real Estate play on Memorial Glade before heading home.

Patrick drove up in the evening. We played tennis at San Pablo Park and later hung out at his friend Yang's place.

Costco with Jen and Brendan on Sunday morning. I cooked lunch afterwards and watched basketball. In the evening I walked to Barnes & Noble to get some inspiration for a personal project I'm starting.
