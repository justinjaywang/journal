- Friday: dinner in the Mission ([Burmese food](http://sfyamo.com/)) first, drinks at [Trick Dog](http://www.trickdogbar.com/) second, then seeing Nina for her birthday at Homestead last. 
- Saturday: Outside Lands music festival. Artist highlights were Trails and Ways, Haim, and Death Cab for Cutie. It was absolutely freezing, so we left before dark and watched *The Grand Budapest Hotel* while we ate takeout.
- Sunday: we hung out in sunny East Bay at the Berkeley Rose Garden and took a nostalgic stroll around campus.
