I've found a new hobby that I never thought I'd enjoy as much as I do: running.
 
It started a couple weeks ago when some of the guys at the office started going on runs in town twice a week to train for a race they signed up for. I tagged along, and was surprised that it came somewhat easily to me. Granted, we weren't running at record speeds, but I was surprisingly good given that I had barely any long distance running experience before that. You tend to enjoy things you're good at, making it all the more important to try new things.

I ran four times out of five this past work week and, like everything I do, I want to do it as best as I can. I'm currently focused on improving my form and getting faster.

Each run is about 4 miles; there are variations on the route, but they all go through a scenic part of town, along the [shoreline](https://www.google.com/maps/@37.915408,-122.383009,15z). During the runs, I'm thankful to be where working where I am. Running also gives me a chance to clear my mind, and refocus for the rest of the day. I feel great afterwards.

I met Jill and Akina for dinner on separate occasions this past week, at [Athineon](http://www.athineon1.com/) and [Bowl'd](http://www.bowldsolano.com/), respectively.

This weekend was spent watching sports, eating, and sleeping. I also got a new pair of Nike running shoes earlier today.
