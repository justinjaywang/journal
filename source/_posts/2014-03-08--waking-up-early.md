I started a new project at work this week. So there's that.

On Thursday evening, I met up with some old classmates (Cole, Michael) and saw a number of others (Zahin, Joyce, Alex, Sahana, Ian) at the [Autodesk Design Night](http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/index?siteID=123112&id=20869299) in the city.

I've also started to implement some lifestyle changes. I started waking up early (around 6), in hopes of being more productive. I'm really enjoying it so far. I've been using the time to work out at the Bridgewater Gym, reading, and/or eating a nice breakfast before heading in to work.
