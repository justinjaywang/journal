![Cal football game.](/images/cal-football.jpg)

This past week in the evenings, I've been working on my typeface project when I'm not watching episodes of *Good Eats*. The project got a restart after my initial idea didn't turn out very well; more on this once it's finished (I made a bet with Akina that I'd finish by Christmas). On Saturday, I went to the Cal football game with Jen, Brendan, and a small group of friends.

I've continued to enjoy cooking after getting home from work. Highlights from this past week:

- Malaysian chicken curry
- Baked potato bowls, with any combination of chives, crispy chicken skin, fried eggs, steamed broccoli
- Chicken noodle soup
- Chicken wings
- Candied ginger
