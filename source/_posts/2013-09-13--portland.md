A while back, Nina threw out the idea that we should visit the Portland office, and take in the sights while there. This past weekend, I took her up on her offer.

We flew in on Saturday and immediately did some exploring—we grabbed lunch from one of Portland's many food carts, did some window shopping, and visited the [Portland Art Museum](http://portlandartmuseum.org/) which had a very cool bicycle design exhibit. That night, we ate an excellent dinner at [Pok Pok](http://www.pokpokpdx.com/home) and then headed downtown to catch a show.

Sunday, we went to a farmer's market and cooked lunch before taking the light rail across the Willamette to do some more exploring on foot. That evening, we ate at [Boke Bowl](http://bokebowl.com/).

Monday through Wednesday we commuted via light rail to the office. The vibe was friendly and intimate. Nina and I worked in the conference room. Lunch at the food carts during those days; Monday was with Jason, Tuesday was with Dan. On Tuesday night we had dinner in Southwest Portland at [Lúc Lác](http://www.luclackitchen.com/).

I'm glad I went; it was an enjoyable trip. Portland is pleasant and a little offbeat, though I couldn't help thinking it's not much more than that.
