With the new year has come some significant changes.

Akina and I had a mutual break up. It's sad, for sure, but change happens. Hopefully, I won't lose her as a friend. She's still my best.

Things are have changed at my apartment, too. Andrew's girlfriend Didi moved in. On top of that, we decided to get a cable plan and Andrew bought new TV over the break. In the end, it's worked out that I'm actually going to be paying less in total rent and utilities than I was previously.

Finally, I've purchased the iPad Air. In fact I'm writing this post on the new device. I've been contemplating getting an iPad for several months, and I finally just went for it. I walked to the Apple Store at Bay Street earlier this evening and bought it. I felt like if I was going to get it eventually, I might as well get it sooner rather than later.

Besides using it for reading (blogs, news, digital books), I plan to use the iPad largely to take notes. I've already begun to practice writing on it with the [GoodNotes](http://www.goodnotesapp.com/) app. Eventually, I want to get comfortable enough writing on it that it can replace almost all pen and paper in my life. For me, in this way, the iPad is a truly inspirational product &mdash; a tool that is powerful, useful, and simplifies our lives. Hopefully, by using it, some of that inspiration will rub off on me.
