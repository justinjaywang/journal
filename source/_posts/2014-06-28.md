I hung out in the city a couple weekends ago. On Friday night, I met up with Kliulai for a movie at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts. Unfortunately, it was sold out so we ended up watching *Edge of Tomorrow* at the Metreon.

We met up with Brian later that night and crashed at his place in the Mission. The next morning, I played basketball with Brian and some of his friends and had Chinese food for lunch. Brian, Kliulai, and I worked on our project in the afternoon and had phở for dinner.

In recent weeks, it's been much of the same thing: work, running, and the World Cup. I've been running regularly at work, and my times are getting faster and endurance better. I've also been watching a lot of soccer. On Thursday, I watched the U.S.–Germany morning match at work with co-workers.
