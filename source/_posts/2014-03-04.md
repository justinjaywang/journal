I've been working on my portfolio this past week; had a goal to finish by the end of the weekend and succeeded. It rained during the week, so there was no soccer or basketball.

In food news, I've been fond of cooking one pot meals in my cast iron combo cooker, tossing in vegetables (kale, tomatoes, carrots, asparagus), meat (chicken thighs), and olive oil in the oven on 350 degrees for an hour and a half.
