Back at the office this week. We've finally submitted our apps, both Windows Phone and Windows Store; still some remaining bugs we'll address in the next update, but it's nevertheless a great accomplishment considering the challenges the team faced.

I shot some hoops with Paul on Wednesday at lunch, but the Thursday game got rained out. I also have been playing ping pong with Matt. Today, after standup (where our project was acknowledged), I walked to El Agricultor food truck with Paul.

Jason gave us the afternoon off, since we've been working a lot over the past couple of weeks to get the project done in time. I took the opportunity to head to the city and do some shopping. I got a shirt jacket at H&M and a shirt at the Levi's Store.
