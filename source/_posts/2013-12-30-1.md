I have to accept the fact that nothing can be the same as it was. People and circumstances are always changing. The past helps shape who we are, but doesn't necessarily define us. I'll always be grateful for the people I've had in my life.

One chapter of my life (an important one) has now come to a close. Another chapter is beginning, and that's exciting.
