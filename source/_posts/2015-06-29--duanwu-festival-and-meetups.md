- watching basketball with Mom
- jam session with Tiffany and Randy; it was a trip relive all the old tunes I used to play and listen to; I keep saying it, but it bears repeating: music used to be such a big part of my life, and I don't want to lose it
- social event at a bar in Long Beach, where I met some other OC designers
- potluck dinner at Uncle Ray's for the Duanwu Festival; I ate two zongzis
- tacos with Alex at Perla's
- developers meetup in Venice; I wanted to see an apartment showing closer to downtown earlier in the day, so I made a day of it; I saw the La Brea Tar Pits, walked along Venice Beach, and had a really delicious lunch in Koreatown
- baseball game with Tiffany; they now have a special Metrolink train for Angels games, so we took that
- watching old episodes of *Community*; I admit I'm not immune to distractions, but I don't mind as much any more; just trying to go with the flow
