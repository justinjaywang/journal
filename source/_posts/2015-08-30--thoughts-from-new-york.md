The diversity of New York was one of the first things that struck me. It feels like the capital of the world, in a way. I never felt like I didn't belong.

I absolutely love the walkability. It's been my favorite part, hands down. As a means of transport, as a form of exercise, and as an activity in and of itself. There's no better way to get a feel for the city. You can walk at all hours, too, without feeling weird like you would if you were to do it back home.

I've been pleasantly surprised by the wealth of public spaces and parks. Public transportation has been great, too. That being said, it still doesn't compare to Taipei in either of these regards.

My least favorite part has been the mosquitos and the muggy weather. I get bit every time I play basketball in Brooklyn. No comparison to Taipei here, either.

The sheer urban-ness has made me crave space, quiet, and nature. Crowded streets, ambulance sirens at all hours, and hot piles of trash will do that to you.

A lot of the people living here seem to be only temporaryâ€”young professionals who work hard for a handful of years, burn out, and then move to the suburbs. Or Cleveland. Living in New York is almost like a rite of passage.

In California, you can't get a plastic bag. In New York, they double bag everything.
