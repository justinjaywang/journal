I went out to lunch with co-workers on Friday at the [Up & Under](http://www.theupandunder.com/), where we celebrated the interns' last day through into the afternoon.

Grace came over for dinner on Sunday. I slow-roasted chicken quarters to go with rosemary potatoes and roasted summer vegetables. We met up with Brendan and Jennifer at Prizefighter later in the night.
