Things I like about my job:

- Relatively quick commute.
- I get my own cubicle.
- Low key, relatively low stress.
- I don't have to worry about work outside of the office.
- I can work on personal projects on weekends and evenings.
- Basketball after work on Wednesdays with some of the guys at the office complex.
- Fitness center.
- Ping pong table.
