- I had Jen and Brendan over for Taiwanese braised pork on Monday night. Iâ€™d spend the entire week finishing the leftovers.
- Lunch with Tony on Tuesday at [Assemble](http://assemblerestaurant.com/) after my compensation review.
- Tuesday night, Cole and I took the BART to the city for Ian's birthday. He rented out a room at the [Homestead](http://www.homesteadsf.com/) and invited a lot of his friends and family.
- I spent another Saturday on campus, this time for a Google-sponsored designathon put on by Berkeley Innovation. Afterwards, I had dinner with some old (and new) friends at [Koryo](http://www.yelp.com/biz/koryo-restaurant-berkeley). The dolsot bibimbap I had was especially good.
- I spent the day on Sunday with Andrew, Didi, Arthur, and Didi's younger sisters to see the [Cherry Blossom Festival](http://sfcherryblossom.org/WP/) in Japantown. Lunch at [Sanppo](http://sanppo.net/).
