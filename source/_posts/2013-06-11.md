Yesterday was the first day of Apple's [WWDC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wwdc), where among other unveilings, they introduced [iOS 7](https://vimeo.com/68114884). Watching the event live was pretty exciting. I spent last night installing a beta version on my iPhone. 

I've gone back and forth about whether I like it or not. Likes: extending views and controls to the edges of the screen, more gesture support, and removal of unnecessary chrome. Dislikes: color palette feels childlike, certain animations (too “enchanting”), and typography (too light).

In the end, I feel a little let down considering they had an opportunity to redesign the OS from the ground up. Overall, it's far too trendy, and fails to achieve the timeless quality Ive said he was going for.

I do think it's a step in the right direction, though. While the design as a whole to me seems disparate right now, I have no doubt Apple will continue to refine and improve it.
