1. This trip was unique was for the time I got to spend with people there, of my own age, who work at Dad's company. We ate meals, played sports, and sang karaoke together. I saw where they lived and where they worked. And I saw their favorite hangout spots. As a result, I feel I have a much better sense of the local culture than I would have otherwise. Plus, now I have friends in the Philippines, which is pretty cool.
2. Being there, away from the social world of back home, was a breath of fresh air. Missing was this notion of "cool". I didn't care what anyone thought and I learned, slowly, to let go. There was no reason to be self-conscious or shy, especially since everyone was so warm, flattering, and engaging—they were so excited when they first met me! Just be you, and you'll have fun.
3. Seeing the infrastructure there and the way certain things operate gives me more of an appreciation for things that I've probably taken for granted, growing up where I have. They're simple things, like: the ability to walk around a city and feel safe, clean air, people that actually try to help you if you ask a question, and service workers that give any shit. Just to name a few.
4. Don't take parents for granted. While I still can, I should get to know Dad as much as possible (especially times when we're on the same continent). During this trip, I came a little closer to understanding some of his motivations. We're alike in a lot of ways; learning about him is partly learning about myself also.
5. I'm fortunate for what I have. Not only did I have the means to travel to a foreign country—which not a lot of people in the world can claim—but I had the time away from work to do so via the freedom to quit my job and be selective with my career. I know I'm spoiled in many ways. The best I can do, then, is try to be happy and show appreciation to those who have worked hard to put me in this situation.
