I feel relieved now that I finally received a new laptop at work earlier this week. That means I don't have to keep bringing in my personal machine and keep work files and programs on it.

Yesterday, I did some reading on (1) real estate investing and (2) *The Art of Innovation*. In the afternoon, I walked to [Doyle Hollis Park](https://foursquare.com/v/doyle-hollis-park/4c4f9be8371520a14ccbebbf) with Brendan and played wiffleball, basketball, and football. I worked on my personal project some, and late at night I rewatched *[Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_sunshine_of_the_spotless_mind)*.

This morning, my plan is to watch the French Open Men's Finals at the club house. Later in the day, maybe shoot some hoops and then catch game two of the NBA Finals.
