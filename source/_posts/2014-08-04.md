Early last week, I had reconnected with a friend from school, Grace. We met up for dinner on Friday night at [Z & Y Restaurant](http://www.zandyrestaurant.com/en/) in Chinatown. Later that night, the two of us met up with Isabelle for her birthday. I also saw Kevin, Sohail, and others from the Walnut house.

On Saturday, Brendan's family drove up for the Real Madridâ€“Inter Milan soccer game. We all had dinner at Townhouse that night, and breakfast at Doyle Street Cafe the following morning.

This week, I met up with Brian in the city on Tuesday night, and I showed the team my work-in-progress MVP. Wednesday night, I went bowling with Jen, Brendan, Diane, and a few of their friends. I finally learned how to hook a bowling ball!

Friday, I had dinner at [SO](http://www.yelp.com/biz/so-san-francisco-4) with Anna. The chicken wings were very good.

Saturday, I did some cleaning up around the house and did some shopping. On Sunday, I played catch for a bit with Brendan at San Pablo Park before heading to the city to meet Grace for dinner and cocktails at [El Techo](http://eltechosf.com/) in the Mission.
