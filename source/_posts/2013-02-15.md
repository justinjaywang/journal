For Valentine's Day, I made a four-course meal for two. I hand-wrote a menu for a fictional restaurant called *Le Petit Radiateur*. Here's what Akina and I had:

1. Salad of spring mix, caramelized baby carrots, sliced strawberries, and raisins tossed in extra virgin olive oil, salt, and pepper.
2. Braised lemon-pepper chicken breast and thigh wrapped in hickory-smoked bacon with a side of pan-browned Brussels sprouts.
3. Roasted pork steak marinated in Dijon mustard topped with an egg cooked over-easy, paired with roasted onions, Russet potatoes, and Beauregard sweet potatoes.
4. Semi-sweet chocolate bark with roasted hazelnuts, roasted almonds, coconut flakes, and dried Bing cherries.
