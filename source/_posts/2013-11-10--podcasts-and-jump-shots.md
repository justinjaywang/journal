I started subscribing to podcasts on my phone and listening to them in the evenings. So far, I've been enjoying [99 Percent Invisible](http://99percentinvisible.org/) and [TED Radio Hour](http://www.npr.org/programs/ted-radio-hour/), along with the usual [Starters](http://thestarters.nba.com/) basketball podcast.

The work week has been fine, not much to report. Been working on my jump shot during lunch.

On Friday, I went to [Tamashii](http://tamashiiramen.com/) with my co-workers Nina, Paul, and Cheryl. 

On Saturday, I spent the early part of the day in Berkeley. I played tennis with Jason and Irena, then hoops, and finally lunch with Patrick at [Smart Alec's](http://www.smartalecs.info/). I got the usual: chef salad with beef patty, plus fries. I spent the rest of the evening at home working on my lyrics website.

Today, I worked more on my project and then went to the city with Jen.

For dinner this week, I've been fond of baked potatoes with tuna, eggs, chives, and [mirepoix](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirepoix_(cuisine)). I also used leftover candied ginger to saut√© carrots, which turned out well. Tonight, I made roasted chicken with root vegetables.
