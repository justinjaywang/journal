![The pool at PPP.](/images/ppp-pool.jpg)

Spent last night and this morning starting to work on my new personal project (details once I finish). 

Then, swimming at Jen's place in the early afternoon, followed by some NBA playoffs. In the evening I headed over to Berkeley to watch Akina perform in a dance show.
