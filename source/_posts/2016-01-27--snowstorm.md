I moved into my new apartment north of Prospect Park a couple weeks ago, and I was welcomed with a winter storm this past weekend. Once the novelty wore off, it was more inconvenient than anything, from my perspective.

It snowed from late Friday night to early Sunday morning, and I just had to stay indoors the whole time. I felt trapped and I didn't like it. The one time I did leave the house, on Sunday afternoon to get groceries in Chinatown, a number of trains weren't running, and walking was difficult since the sidewalks were covered with snow. They still are.
