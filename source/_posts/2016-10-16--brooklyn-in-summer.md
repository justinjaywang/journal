During the summer, I'd gotten into a routine of work (still walking to the office and back every day despite the heat), basketball on Saturday mornings, mostly cooking, sometimes eating out (Zaytoon's, [Superiority Burger](http://www.superiorityburger.com/), the [Impossible Burger](http://ny.eater.com/2016/7/26/12277310/david-chang-impossible-burger-nishi) at Momofuku Nishi), design events, and going out with friends on occasion.

In July, I visited home for a couple weeks (Jen was back, too).

I finished a personal project, a typeface called [Manifesto](http://manifesto.justinjay.wang/), and enrolled in a typeface design course at [The Cooper Union](http://coopertype.org/) in Manhattan, which began earlier this month.

I joined a gym near work about a month ago; I've been going a few times a week and making sure I get enough food in me. I had seen some pictures of myself and was shocked at how skinny I'd gotten. It was like I didn't recognize the body that my head was on.

At the end of the month, I'm moving into a studio apartment in South Slope.
