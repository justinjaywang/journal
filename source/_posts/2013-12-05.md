I walked to Berkeley Bowl to get groceries earlier this week. I got some new ingredients to try in my cooking: rutabaga, parsnips, leeks, kale, and apple.

At the office this week, I played basketball on Tuesday, tennis on Wednesday, and ping pong (the table is finally back) on Thursday.

I also finished rereading *How to Win Friends and Influence People*.
