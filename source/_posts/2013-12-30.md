It's been a good break so far. I got to make some meals for Mom and Jen, such as slow-roasted pork shoulder two ways (one in garlic oil, one in tomato sauce), slow-roasted chicken thighs, frittata, and oxtail stew. And on Christmas, we went over to the Wanningers for dinner (ham, green beans, and salads).

I got to see some friends, too: Souplantation with Kevin, Tiffany, and Byron; basketball at Gallup with the usual crew; and Josh came over a couple days ago. Yesterday, Akina drove down to visit and we went to the beach and ate Wingstop. Later, we met up with Chris to see [*Her*](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1798709/), the new movie by Spike Jonze.
