It's been a week and a half since I moved back home, and I'm enjoying my time very muchâ€”the pace seems slower here, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Not being in a hurry means more time for contemplation, for being in the moment, for focus.

I'm continuing to make good progress on my current [personal project](http://llllyrics.com) while eating healthy and exercising. Some meals I've been cooking: spaghettied zucchini and raspberry red leaf salad, soy-braised pork ribs, lemon and dill salmon with asparagus, and Taiwanese pork cutlet. Mom has been cooking as well, often helping to prepare the vegetables.

Other things:

- regular walks with Mom at the neighborhood park, plus once at the Laguna Niguel regional park
- eating persimmons we bought at the newly-opened [international market](http://www.wholesomechoice.com/about.php)
- going to the Ducks game with the cousins
- basketball at Gallup with the usual gang
