First photoshoot with my new Micro Four Thirds camera. I treated myself to the lens, a Lumix 20mm f/1.7, and Akina gave me the body, an Olympus PEN E-PL1, as a gift.

I'd been wanting a nicer camera for a number of years and decided the timing was right to get one now. I happen to love lo-fi photography, but there's a certain aesthetic that these cameras bring that I'd love to use for food photography and for documenting my life.
