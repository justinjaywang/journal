Last week, I went hiking with Alisha at the [Laguna Coast Wilderness Park](http://ocparks.com/parks/lagunac/). This week with Josh, I went on a hike near the high school on Thursday and then a bike ride to Laguna Niguel on Saturday. I briefly met up with Brian for yogurt that night.

Other than that, I've just been walking and grocery shopping with Mom, cooking, and working on projects.
