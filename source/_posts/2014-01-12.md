On Friday night, I went to Brendan's work party in Berkeley with Jennifer and Brendan. There was a fun game where you could guess the number of items in a jar. You write down the answer, and the closest guess without going over wins the contents of that jar (there were jars of limes, of peppers, and of hot tamales). I was very close for all three, but didn't end up winning. But it was fun to play. If I throw a party I'm definitely going to do this.

The other memorable activity was the fortune teller. I was curious so I had mine told. I asked her, "How do I stay inspired?". That was my New Year's resolution, after all. She had me shuffle a deck of tarot cards and flip over four. In her reading, she had suggested that I'm often stuck in the same patterns of thought or ideas that aren't working. When that happens, I just need to relax. Furthermore, inspiration will come if I keep my mind open to new experiences and go with the flow, so to speak. Very good advice for anybody. The best ideas often come when you aren't expecting them or even looking for them. Let life happen.

Saturday was a nice day. In the morning, I played tennis with Jason in Berkeley. Afterwards, I also stopped by Buffalo Exchange to trade in some old clothes for a new shirt. For lunch, I cooked bacon with Brussels sprouts and watched some of the NFL playoffs with Andrew and Didi. 

At night, I hung out at Jen's, where we ate leftover pork shoulder and fries and watched the "Fresh Off the Boat" video series, hosted by chef [Eddie Huang](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Huang). I was into it. In the series, he travels to various locations (Taiwan, Bay Area, Los Angeles); there, hosts treat him to local culture and cuisine. The episodes in Taiwan made me want to visit again, and perhaps approach it from a different perspective this time.

Today, I worked on redesigning my home page and watched the 49ers game at home. I also created a new layout for this blog.
