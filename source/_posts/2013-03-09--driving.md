I'm spending a lot of time driving. Definitely more than I'd like. On the way to work, on the way back, or stopping in Berkeley. I noticed in general it tended to make me angry, so I started singing.

Now I use time in the car as singing practice, where I can sing as much falsetto as I want. It's the one place I can do so freely. I'm no longer in a hurry to get anywhere, and that makes me less grumpy and more happy.
