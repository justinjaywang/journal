Taiwan food, to me, is comfort food. and I found my new favorite dish: Pacific saury with rice *bian dang*. I love to eat the whole thing, including head, tail, and innards (which are magnificently bitter). I’ve also been trying new breads (peanut butter bread, walnut raisin cake) and other sweets (sweet red bean, green bean, peanut, barley, hot herbal grassy jelly, fried sesame ball).

I'm obsessed now with food.


*Self-serve buffets*

I ate tons of guava (I think I found my new favorite fruit). Also I ate wax apple, Buddha's head fruit, starfruit, papaya, loquat, jujube.
