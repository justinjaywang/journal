It's been a little over a week since I quit my job. Already I can feel that the pace of my life has picked up, and that's a good thing.

My first move was to pursue this startup idea with Brian, and begin recruiting people to join. On Sunday, I met with Edmund for brunch at [Suppenküche](http://www.suppenkuche.com/welcome.html). More lunches and dinners with friends throughout the week to chat: Monday night, sushi with Brandon; Tuesday night, Vietnamese food with the BI alums; Wednesday, lunch with Edmund (phở) and then dinner with Pavel (Z & Y Chinese). As such, I had crashed at Brian's Tuesday night and then spent Wednesday in the city working at a café and at the Metreon.

Saturday, I stopped by the Hardly Strictly Bluegrass Festival at Golden Gate Park with Cole and Felicia. They drove, and I provided the sandwiches from Togo's. That night, I went over to Jen's for dinner while we watched the baseball playoffs.

Working on this idea full-time during the week gave me a glimpse of what it'd be like long-term. I could see fairly quickly it wasn't going to work out. The moments of severe doubt outweighed the moments of inspiration. The biggest questions I had were (1) is this the right team? (2) is this product something that people want? I'd be lying to myself if I said yes. I knew in my heart it wasn't the right opportunity. I met with Brian to tell him on Sunday night.
