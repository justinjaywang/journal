The post-retreat weeks were hectic, mostly because I hadn't yet found a place to stay. I'm lucky to have friends and family in the city, and a couple of them offered to put me up while I secured a place.

I got back to the city on Friday and moved into my friends' place in Stuy Town for the weekend. I went out for drinks later that night with my hosts (one of them was celebrating her birthday) and then met up with Chris to see a stand-up comedy show in the Central Village.

I didn't get to sleep much that night, though. One of the friends that I was staying with was sick. It got so bad that I had to take her to the hospital early in the morning. Turns out she had a stomach flu and would be OK with some rest, but I spent the better part of the day with one of her roommates running errands and helping to wash her sheets that she had thrown up on. In the evening, I took it easy and finally got some rest.

Brian, Youmi, and Leah happened to be in town for the weekend, too. We got Sunday brunch at Cafe Mogador and went thrifting in Williamsburg in the afternoon. That night, I stayed in and watched some TV with my temporary roommates.

I had the day off on Monday for Columbus Day. I hung out in the apartment in the morning with Carolina, ordered a porchetta sandwich for lunch, and then moved back over to Michael's in the afternoon.

**That night**, I had bún at a nearby Vietnamese café and made friends with the server, who was from Thailand.

The work week was good. Since I was staying at Michael's, I ate out for lunch. I had sandwiches from Num Pang (coconut shrimp, and then bacon and fig), a Vietnamese rice bowl from Saigon Shack, and lu rou fan from Baohaus. I spent evenings visiting apartments. Finding housing became like a second job. I saw a place that I liked on Thursday night in Prospect Heights and decided to later that night to take it after they offered it to me.

On Friday night, I hung out at home and watched *The Voice* with Michael and Parilee. The next day, I played basketball in the morning, had lunch at another Vietnamese restaurant, and then moved to an Airbnb, where I'd stay for a few nights before my sublet started.

**The Airbnb** was in Brooklyn's Bensonhurst, a neighborhood with a large Chinese population. Relocating there would make the move to my new sublet easier on Wednesday. The host was very friendly and chatty.

I had full access to the kitchen, so for those few days I cooked meals of orzo pasta with celery, eggs, and tomatoes to go with my staple of oatmeal, peanut butter, and fruit (this week, grapes).

My first night there, I attended my soon-to-be housemates' housewarming party where I chatted with them and got to meet some of their friends. I think we'll get along pretty well. They're all NYU grads from a few years ago. One is an engineer, one is in advertising, and one is a graphic designer.

The next morning, I met up with Alisha, who was in town visiting. It was chilly, so we grabbed some hot tea on the Upper East Side before taking a stroll in Central Park. After that, I immediately walked over to Uniqlo to buy thermal layers and a beanie.

After work on Monday and Tuesday, I hung out in my room: I listened to music, watched some shows, and talked with Josh on the phone. Early Wednesday morning, I moved my stuff into the new sublet.

**I chose** the new place for the location, timeframe, room, and people. It's north of Prospect Park and the Brooklyn Museum, and east of Barclays Center and Downtown Brooklyn. The rent is much cheaper than in Manhattan, for sure, and is very good for the size of the room. My sublease lasts until the end of March, so I'll have a home through the winter. Moving around is tough.

I found a new local grocery store, a small 24-hour shop called Mr. Melon, which also makes its own juices and smoothies. Thursday night, I went out for drinks with my new roommates at a beer hall near our apartment called [Berg'n](http://www.bergn.com/). I was impressed both by its interior design (a large space with long, communal bench tables and an enclosed outdoor patio) and its cocktails (El Duderino, a vegan White Russian).

On Saturday, I played basketball with the usual gang, had lunch with Byron (who was in town for training at his new job) at [Spicy Village](http://www.spicyvillagenyc.com/) in Chinatown (their big plate of chicken was delicious), and had Vietnamese for dinner with Carolina. I then had a lazy Sunday: I stayed in, took naps, and watched episodes of *The Voice*, *Modern Family*, and Anthony Bourdain's *The Layover*. I think that I was just exhausted from the past few weeks.

The next week, work was fine and I was more productive. We're working on the new version of Siteleaf and are getting ready to invite beta testers. I also had a chat with Skylar about my future at Oak. It was positive—they'd like to continue working with me, and in what capacity is up to me. I said I'd think it over.

I'm going home to California for the week on Saturday. It'll be the first time I'll have been back in a little over three months.
