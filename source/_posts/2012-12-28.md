Back home for winter break now, resting up and taking care of Mom. It still hasn't completely hit me that I'm  done with school. The last five plus years were a blur. I learned so much about myself, and I'm bound to learn even more as I start work (next month at [Vertigo](http://vertigo.com/)).

Prior to being home, I took a detour on the drive back home fom the Bay to Lake Tahoe with Akina, where we mostly preferred to stay indoors by the fire.
