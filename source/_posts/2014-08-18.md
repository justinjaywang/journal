I spent a wonderful weekend with Grace. Dinner in the Mission on Friday night, seeing Nina for her birthday at Homestead. Outside Lands music festival on Saturday, where we saw Trails and Ways, Haim, and Death Cab for Cutie. Sunday, we hung out in sunny East Bay at the Berkeley Rose Garden and took a nostalgic stroll around campus.

The following week, I had lunch out with co-workers on Friday at Up & Under in town, where we celebrated the internsâ€™ last day.

I had Grace over for dinner on Sunday. I slow-roasted chicken quarters to go with rosemary potatoes and roasted summer vegetables. We met up with Brendan and Jennifer at Prizefighter later in the night.
