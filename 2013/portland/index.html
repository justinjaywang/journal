This past weekend, I took her up on her offer.</p><p>We flew in on Saturday and immediately did some exploring—we grabbed lunch from one of Portland’s many food carts, did some window shopping, and visited the <a href="http://portlandartmuseum.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">Portland Art Museum</a> which had a very cool bicycle design exhibit. That night, we ate an excellent dinner at <a href="http://www.pokpokpdx.com/home" target="_blank" rel="external">Pok Pok</a> and then headed downtown to catch a show.</p><p>Sunday, we went to a farmer’s market and cooked lunch before taking the light rail across the Willamette to do some more exploring on foot. That evening, we ate at <a href="http://bokebowl.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Boke Bowl</a>.</p><p>Monday through Wednesday we commuted via light rail to the office. The vibe was friendly and intimate. Nina and I worked in the conference room. Lunch at the food carts during those days; Monday was with Jason, Tuesday was with Dan. On Tuesday night we had dinner in Southwest Portland at <a href="http://www.luclackitchen.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Lúc Lác</a>.</p><p>I’m glad I went; it was an enjoyable trip. Portland is pleasant and a little offbeat, though I couldn’t help thinking it’s not much more than that.</p></section><footer class="post-footer container container--narrow"><ul class="post-tag-list"><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/food/">food</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/portland/">portland</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/vacation/">vacation</a></li></ul></footer></article><script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.0.3/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/js/all.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">!function(e,a,t,n,c,o,s){e.GoogleAnalyticsObject=c,e[c]=e[c]||function(){(e[c].q=e[c].q||[]).push(arguments)},e[c].l=1*new Date,o=a.createElement(t),s=a.getElementsByTagName(t)[0],o.async=1,o.src=n,s.parentNode.insertBefore(o,s)}(window,document,"script","//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js","ga"),ga("create","UA-15132368-6","auto"),ga("send","pageview");</script></body></html>
