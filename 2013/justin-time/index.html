Fridays nights are sacred; they’re Justin time. No offense, but I feel like I could be doing something more productive. This trend dates back to my college days, when I almost always regretted going to parties and would have rather have spent the time improving my skills, such as playing guitar. I think I’m just different in this way.</p><p>I love nights where I’m feeling inspired and my mind is swimming. Tonight is one of those nights. It started with the question “Who do I want to be in five years?” and the realization that I need to be more disciplined to achieve my vision. I can’t lose sight of who I am and who I want to be. So I sent an email to myself, 5 years in <a href="http://www.futureme.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">the future</a> as a checkpoint.</p><p>I also came across ideas for <a href="http://www.stumbleupon.com/su/1GDCAp/:1uZG5T2Sq:qTeKzgqt/www.highexistence.com/30-challenges-for-30-days/" target="_blank" rel="external">challenges</a> that was inspired by Matt Cutt’s <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/matt_cutts_try_something_new_for_30_days.html" target="_blank" rel="external">TED talk</a> about trying something new for 30 days.</p><p>If there’s something I’d like to change about myself or I just want to form a good habit, nothing’s stopping me. So I might as well do it as soon as possible. These are the challenges I chose:</p><ul><li>Take a walk each day. I can easily accomplish this by walking into town on work days, or in the evenings to Trader Joe’s.</li><li>Take a cold shower each day. Or when I do take a shower, make it a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shower#Scottish_shower" target="_blank" rel="external">Scottish shower</a>. Acccording to many sources they have real <a href="http://www.artofmanliness.com/2010/01/18/the-james-bond-shower-a-shot-of-cold-water-for-health-and-vitality/" target="_blank" rel="external">health benefits</a>.</li><li>Keep a dream journal. I’ve been dreaming a lot lately. I briefly flirted with writing my dreams a couple years ago, but didn’t keep it up.</li><li>100 push ups each day. I’ve already been doing this for the last two weeks.</li><li>Be honest, to myself and to others.</li></ul><p>These can start off as 30 day challenges, but can easily become lifelong habits.</p></section><footer class="post-footer container container--narrow"><ul class="post-tag-list"><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/reflection/">reflection</a></li></ul></footer></article><script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.0.3/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/js/all.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">!function(e,a,t,n,c,o,s){e.GoogleAnalyticsObject=c,e[c]=e[c]||function(){(e[c].q=e[c].q||[]).push(arguments)},e[c].l=1*new Date,o=a.createElement(t),s=a.getElementsByTagName(t)[0],o.async=1,o.src=n,s.parentNode.insertBefore(o,s)}(window,document,"script","//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js","ga"),ga("create","UA-15132368-6","auto"),ga("send","pageview");</script></body></html>
