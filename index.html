But I’m lucky to have friends and family in the city, and a couple of them offered to put me up while I secured a place.</p><p>I got back to the city on Friday and moved into my friends’ place in Stuy Town for the weekend. I went out for drinks later that night with my hosts (one of them was celebrating her birthday) and then met up with Chris to see a stand-up comedy show in the Central Village.</p><p>I barely slept that night, unfortunately. Carolina was sick and vomiting. It got so bad that I had to take her to the hospital early in the morning (turns out she had a stomach flu). When we got back in the late morning, she needed to rest, so Amy and I ran errands and took care of things for her, including washing her sheets which had puke on them. I also stopped by an apartment in the neighborhood to see about a potential sublet. In the evening, I took it easy and finally got some rest.</p><p>Brian, Youmi, and Leah were in town for the weekend. We got Sunday brunch at Cafe Mogador and went thrifting in Williamsburg in the afternoon. That night, I stayed in and watched some TV with my temporary roommates.</p><p>I had the day off on Monday for Columbus Day. I hung out in the apartment in the morning, ordered a porchetta sandwich for lunch, and then moved back over to Michael’s in the afternoon.</p><hr><p><strong>That night</strong>, I had bún at a nearby Vietnamese café and made friends with the server, who was from Thailand.</p><p>The work week was good. Since I was staying at Michael’s, I ate out for lunch. I had sandwiches from Num Pang (coconut shrimp, and then bacon and fig), a Vietnamese rice bowl from Saigon Shack, and lu rou fan from Baohaus. I spent evenings visiting apartments. Finding housing became like a second job. I saw a place that I liked on Thursday night in Prospect Heights and decided to later that night to take it after they offered it to me.</p><p>On Friday night, I hung out at home and watched <em>The Voice</em> with Michael and Parilee. The next day, I played basketball in the morning, had lunch at another Vietnamese restaurant, and then moved to an Airbnb, where I’d stay for a few nights before my sublet started.</p><hr><p><strong>The Airbnb</strong> was in Brooklyn’s Bensonhurst, a neighborhood with a large Chinese population. Relocating there would make the move to my new sublet easier on Wednesday. The host was very friendly and chatty.</p><p>I had full access to the kitchen, so for those few days I cooked meals of orzo pasta with celery, eggs, and tomatoes to go with my staple of oatmeal, peanut butter, and fruit (this week, grapes).</p><p>My first night there, I attended my soon-to-be housemates’ housewarming party where I chatted with them and got to meet some of their friends. I think we’ll get along pretty well. They’re all NYU grads from a few years ago. One is an engineer, one is in advertising, and one is a graphic designer.</p><p>The next morning, I met up with Alisha, who was in town visiting. It was chilly, so we grabbed some hot tea on the Upper East Side before taking a stroll in Central Park. After that, I immediately walked over to Uniqlo to buy thermal layers and a beanie.</p><p>After work on Monday and Tuesday, I hung out in my room: I listened to music, watched some shows, and talked with Josh on the phone. Early Wednesday morning, I moved my stuff into the new sublet.</p><hr><p><strong>I chose</strong> the new place for the location, timeframe, room, and people. It’s north of Prospect Park and the Brooklyn Museum, and east of Barclays Center and Downtown Brooklyn. The rent is much cheaper than in Manhattan, for sure, and is very good for the size of the room. My sublease lasts until the end of March, so I’ll have a home through the winter. Moving around is tough.</p><p>I found a new local grocery store, a small 24-hour shop called Mr. Melon, which also makes its own juices and smoothies. Thursday night, I went out for drinks with my new roommates at a beer hall near our apartment called <a href="http://www.bergn.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Berg’n</a>. I was impressed both by its interior design (a large space with long, communal bench tables and an enclosed outdoor patio) and its cocktails (El Duderino).</p><p>On Saturday, I played basketball with the usual gang, had lunch with Byron (who was in town for training at his new job) at <a href="http://www.spicyvillagenyc.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Spicy Village</a> in Chinatown (their big plate of chicken was delicious), and had Vietnamese for dinner with Carolina. I then had a lazy Sunday: I stayed in, took naps, and watched episodes of <em>The Voice</em>, <em>Modern Family</em>, and Anthony Bourdain’s <em>The Layover</em>. I think that I was just exhausted from the past few weeks.</p><p>The next week, work was fine and I was more productive. We’re working on the new version of Siteleaf and are getting ready to invite beta testers. I also had a chat with Skylar about my future at Oak. It was positive—they’d like to continue working with me, and in what capacity is up to me. I said I’d think it over.</p><p>I’m going home to California for the week on Saturday. It’ll be the first time I’ll have been back in a little over three months.</p></section><footer class="post-footer container container--narrow"><ul class="post-tag-list"><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/daily/">daily</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/food/">food</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/new-york/">new york</a></li></ul></footer></article><article class="post" data-post-id="cigukoqdq0007a00hbp5jz3d1"><header class="post-header container container--narrow"><a href="/2015/oakweek/"><time class="post-date" datetime="2015-10-13T00:55:42.000Z">Mon, 12 Oct 2015</time><h1 class="post-title">Oakweek</h1></a></header><section class="post-content container container--narrow"><p>This year for Oak’s annual weeklong retreat, called Oakweek, we drove to a small town called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerhonkson,_New_York" target="_blank" rel="external">Kerhonkson</a>, a few hours north of the city.

I met Dad in Berkeley first, then we stopped for some Vietnamese bún before BARTing to the city to find him a suit for the wedding.</p><p>The next morning, we walked over to Hotel Durant. When Jen and Brendan arrived, I helped unload stuff and then made a Costco run with Brendan, his dad, and Mike. For lunch, I had dry-fried green beans over rice at the Asian Ghetto. In the evening, we had rehearsal at the stadium and then dinner with family and friends at Angeline’s.</p><p>Saturday was filled with helping for the wedding, pictures for the wedding, the wedding itself, and more helping for the wedding. I ate leftover jambalaya from Angeline’s in the morning, then leftover baby back ribs for lunch. The venue was beautiful, the ceremony and reception went smoothly, and everyone seemed to have a good time.</p><p>I saw Jason early the next morning; we drove to a diner on 4th Street for breakfast and then chatted for a bit afterwards. Back at the hotel, I helped load up the remaining items as people checked out and went their separate ways. After lunch at Long Life Vegi house in downtown Berkeley with Mom and Dad, I traveled with Mom down to Jen’s place in San Jose. We ate at a Taiwanese restaurant for dinner, then dropped Mom off at the airport. I stayed over at Jen and Brendan’s that night. We hung out, just like old times, and I met the newest member of the family, their dog Zucchi.</p><p>The next day, the three of us drove to Berkeley to meet Dad for lunch at Turkish Kitchen. I walked with Dad around campus in the afternoon; in the evening, I had bún again with Dad and then headed to the airport.</p></section><footer class="post-footer container container--narrow"><ul class="post-tag-list"><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/berkeley/">berkeley</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/family/">family</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/food/">food</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/vacation/">vacation</a></li></ul></footer></article><article class="post" data-post-id="cigukoqdw000ma00huyokjkg0"><header class="post-header container container--narrow"><a href="/2015/new-and-old-friends/"><time class="post-date" datetime="2015-09-24T16:48:49.000Z">Thu, 24 Sep 2015</time><h1 class="post-title">New and old friends</h1></a></header><section class="post-content container container--narrow"><ul><li>drinks in the East Village for Anouck’s birthday</li><li>hoops on Saturday morning in Brooklyn</li><li>more furniture assemply and hanging out with the girls in Apt. 6B</li><li>hoops after work on Wednesday with Chris Rawles at Riverside Park</li><li>lunch talk by typographer Bruno Maag in Gowanus with Skylar from Oak</li><li>Whitney Museum on Friday night with Carolyn</li><li>hoops on Saturday morning in Brooklyn</li><li>late night beers with Carolina</li><li>Sunday afternoon out with Carolina and Amy</li><li>suit shopping for Jen’s wedding; I ended up buying one in ultra skinny fit from Topman</li><li>hoops and dinner at Han Dynasty with Chris</li></ul></section><footer class="post-footer container container--narrow"><ul class="post-tag-list"><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/daily/">daily</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/food/">food</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/new-york/">new york</a></li></ul></footer></article><article class="post" data-post-id="cigukoqdy000qa00hwh0clp6u"><header class="post-header container container--narrow"><a href="/2015/labor-day/"><time class="post-date" datetime="2015-09-11T01:16:21.000Z">Thu, 10 Sep 2015</time><h1 class="post-title">Labor Day</h1></a></header><section class="post-content container container--narrow"><p>The past week was extremely busy, but fun. The project I’d been working for the last month and a half shipped on Tuesday, so I was focused on getting everything done in time. I put in extra hours in the mornings and evenings working from home, and a good chunk of the long weekend was spent in front of my laptop. I didn’t mind at all, though, since it’s work I like to do. It was exhilarating. I hadn’t felt that way since back in school.</p><p>I’m proud of the end result. We all became experts in a framework and language that were completely new to us at the start. I learned a lot of lessons on this project, too—don’t take shortcuts (they always catch up to you), don’t settle for a hack, and be patient and deliberate.</p><p>On top of this, I moved apartments in the middle of the week. What little time I had not working was spent getting set up and settled into my new place. Funny story, actually:</p><p>I met my new roommates Monday night to get the keys, and my new roommate Justin helped me move the couch from my old apartment. Afterwards, I went for a walk around the complex and ended up helping two other people move in in separate instances (I was already sweaty, so it was fine). The first person I helped because the mover offered me 20 bucks help him carry large furniture. I was about to head home after that when I passed by a girl with a bunch of luggage who looked lost, so I offered to help. When she was able to track down her roommates, they came down and we all helped carry her stuff up to the apartment.</p><p>I didn’t have time to get groceries and cook, so I ate out for lunch during the latter half of the week after I moved. I had cold-skin noodles, bánh mì ga, and a Cambodian coconut shrimp sandwich.</p><p>I played basketball in Brooklyn again on Saturday—it’s something I look forward to every week. Later that night, the girl who I helped move earlier in the week and her roommates invited me over for dinner. I stopped by again on Sunday and Monday (Labor Day) to help them build IKEA furniture, and they treated me to dinner on Monday night.</p><p>Sunday, I finally saw Michael again, for Tibetan noodles in Jackson Heights, Queens. Monday morning, I walked to Chinatown for groceries and cooked a pot of lu rou for lunch.</p></section><footer class="post-footer container container--narrow"><ul class="post-tag-list"><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/daily/">daily</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/food/">food</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/labor-day/">labor day</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/new-york/">new york</a></li></ul></footer></article><article class="post" data-post-id="cigukoqe3000wa00hhii7u0x8"><header class="post-header container container--narrow"><a href="/2015/thoughts-from-new-york/"><time class="post-date" datetime="2015-08-30T21:15:42.000Z">Sun, 30 Aug 2015</time><h1 class="post-title">Thoughts from New York</h1></a></header><section class="post-content container container--narrow"><p>The diversity of New York was one of the first things that struck me. It feels like the capital of the world, in a way. You can meet people from anywhere here. As an Asian American, I never felt like I didn’t belong.</p><p>I absolutely love the walkability. It’s been my favorite part, hands down. As a means of transport, as a form of exercise, and as an activity in and of itself. There’s no better way to get a feel for the city. You can walk at all hours, too, without feeling weird like you would if you were to do it back home.</p><p>I’ve been pleasantly surprised by the wealth of public spaces and parks. Public transportation has been great, too. That being said, it still doesn’t compare to Taipei in either of these regards.</p><p>My least favorite part has been the mosquitos and the muggy weather. I get bit every time I play basketball in Brooklyn. No comparison to Taipei here, either.</p><p>The sheer urban-ness has made me crave space, quiet, and nature. Crowded streets, ambulance sirens at all hours, and hot piles of trash will do that to you.</p><p>A lot of the people living here seem to be only temporary—young professionals who work hard for a handful of years, burn out, and then move to the suburbs. Or Cleveland. Living in New York is almost like a rite of passage.</p><p><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/4291520/journal-images/new-york-chinatown.jpg" alt="Manhattan&#39;s Chinatown."><br><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/4291520/journal-images/new-york-tompkins.jpg" alt="Tompkins Square Park in the East Village."><br><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/4291520/journal-images/new-york-east-river.jpg" alt="View of the East River from the Upper East Side."></p></section><footer class="post-footer container container--narrow"><ul class="post-tag-list"><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/new-york/">new york</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/reflection/">reflection</a></li></ul></footer></article><article class="post" data-post-id="cigukoqe60010a00hz937rrt4"><header class="post-header container container--narrow"><a href="/2015/new-york-pt-3/"><time class="post-date" datetime="2015-08-30T21:15:32.000Z">Sun, 30 Aug 2015</time><h1 class="post-title">New York, pt. 3</h1></a></header><section class="post-content container container--narrow"><ul><li>work</li><li>cooking</li><li>picnic in Central Park with Anouck</li><li>basketball in Brooklyn with Justin B.</li><li>walks along the East River and in the neighborhood</li><li>listening to Simon &amp; Garfunkel</li><li>watching <em>Hey Arnold!</em> and <em>30 Rock</em> (notice a theme?)</li><li>found a new place for next month, in the same apartment complex</li></ul></section><footer class="post-footer container container--narrow"><ul class="post-tag-list"><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/daily/">daily</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/new-york/">new york</a></li></ul></footer></article><article class="post" data-post-id="cigukoqe80013a00h7zs9lheg"><header class="post-header container container--narrow"><a href="/2015/new-york-pt-2/"><time class="post-date" datetime="2015-08-16T10:09:19.000Z">Sun, 16 Aug 2015</time><h1 class="post-title">New York, pt. 2</h1></a></header><section class="post-content container container--narrow"><p>New York has so many options for eating out, and from every type of cuisine—I’ve already had Middle Eastern, Mediterranean, Caribbean, Mexican, Peruvian, Chinese, Taiwanese, Japanese, Vietnamese, Cambodian, Thai, and of course, American. Still, I was glad to start cooking again when I moved into my sublet. It’s cheaper, healthier, and often just tastes better.</p><p>I walked to Chinatown last weekend to shop for groceries and get some kitchen supplies. I made <em>lu rou</em> with fried tofu, along with Taiwanese cabbage, kale, carrots, and sunny side up eggs; I packed the leftovers in a rice bowl as lunch for the past week. The coming week’s menu includes tomato eggs, julienned carrots, Taiwanese cabbage, braised king oyster mushrooms, and pickled mustard greens.</p><p>I’m settled into my sublet now, too. My room is huge, and even has a TV. More importantly, it has air conditioning. I really love the apartment complex. It’s got plenty of walking space, trees, lawns, and basketball courts. I go for walks in the evenings, when it’s nice and cool. I’ve shot hoops a few times here and played pickup once, though I’ve still been heading to Brooklyn to play on Saturday mornings.</p></section><footer class="post-footer container container--narrow"><ul class="post-tag-list"><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/daily/">daily</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/food/">food</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/new-york/">new york</a></li></ul></footer></article><article class="post" data-post-id="cigukoqea0017a00hhpd8hspw"><header class="post-header container container--narrow"><a href="/2015/new-york-pt-1/"><time class="post-date" datetime="2015-08-07T04:08:54.000Z">Fri, 7 Aug 2015</time><h1 class="post-title">New York, pt. 1</h1></a></header><section class="post-content container container--narrow"><p>The first couple of weeks have been a whirlwind. I flew in the night of the 19th and started work the next morning. My flight was delayed too, so I ended up having to take a cab just to arrive at Michael and Parilee’s apartment before 11pm. I remember being so tired and sleep-deprived those first few days, yet I had to figure everything out on the go. It was a bit of a culture shock at first, but I’ve adjusted.</p><p>The internship has been good, overall. The guys are super laid back, and I have a ton of freedom. Plus, they all have great taste and work on useful projects. The office is in Union Square, so there’s a ton of lunch options nearby (<a href="http://taboonette.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Taboonette</a> and <a href="http://numpangnyc.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Num Pang</a> are right around the corner).</p><p>While staying at Michael and Parilee’s, I’d take the subway to work in the mornings; in the evenings, I occasionally opted to walk home. It’s a long walk (about an hour and a half to the Upper East Side), but there’s no better way to see the city. Along the way, I passed by places like Rockefeller Center, the Empire State Building, and Times Square. Sometimes I’d stop in Central Park, eat a light dinner that I packed, and people-watch. On my first day off on Saturday, I explored Chinatown in the morning and got <em>ji tui fan</em> for lunch.</p><p>I’ve seen some friends while I’ve been here, too. Akina introduced me to <a href="http://xianfoods.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Xi’an Famous Foods</a>, and I’ve already been back to eat there multiple times (their cold-skin noodles have been the best thing I’ve eaten here so far). Laura was in town, too. I hung out with her in Brooklyn on Saturday; we saw the Brooklyn Museum with Kelly, strolled through Prospect Park with Dmitry, and then had dinner and drinks. I also had dinner the following week (soba in SoHo) with Carolyn, who I also knew from school.</p><p>This past Saturday, I played basketball in the morning with Dmitry in Crown Heights. I moved into my sublet in the East Village later that afternoon. I crammed into a crowded subway car and then labored down 14th Street carrying my stuff. The place was a mess when I arrived, but I’ve been slowly cleaning and making it feel like a home, somewhat. That night, I returned to Brooklyn for Dmitry’s house party, and I saw even more people from Berkeley, like McKenna and Isi.</p></section><footer class="post-footer container container--narrow"><ul class="post-tag-list"><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/daily/">daily</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/food/">food</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/new-york/">new york</a></li></ul></footer></article><article class="post" data-post-id="cigukoqed001ba00h2vyt0z9f"><header class="post-header container container--narrow"><a href="/2015/pre-new-york/"><time class="post-date" datetime="2015-07-23T00:54:17.000Z">Wed, 22 Jul 2015</time><h1 class="post-title">Pre-New York</h1></a></header><section class="post-content container container--narrow"><ul><li>ordered a new MacBook Pro to replace my old one of five years, which had gotten way too slow; took a few days to get the new one set up just how I like it</li><li>got new all-black Vans; they’ll be my New York shoes</li><li>SW Seafood in Irvine with Mom, Uncle Ray, Aunt Jenny, Alex, and Wei; it was a going-away dinner, of sorts, for me and Alex, who’s going to New Orleans next month for school</li><li>bought and installed a new printer for Mom</li><li>Souplantation for dinner with Josh, Joyce, Randy, Youmi, and Leah; drinks and hanging out at Youmi’s afterwards</li><li>laundry, packing, and apartment hunting</li></ul></section><footer class="post-footer container container--narrow"><ul class="post-tag-list"><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/daily/">daily</a></li></ul></footer></article></main><footer class="page-footer"><nav class="nav nav--pagination"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="nav-item"></li><li class="nav-item"><a href="/page/2/" class="nav-link nav-link--center">1 of 15</a></li><li class="nav-item"><a href="/page/2/" class="nav-link">Next</a></li></ul></nav></footer><script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.0.3/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/js/all.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">!function(e,a,t,n,c,o,s){e.GoogleAnalyticsObject=c,e[c]=e[c]||function(){(e[c].q=e[c].q||[]).push(arguments)},e[c].l=1*new Date,o=a.createElement(t),s=a.getElementsByTagName(t)[0],o.async=1,o.src=n,s.parentNode.insertBefore(o,s)}(window,document,"script","//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js","ga"),ga("create","UA-15132368-6","auto"),ga("send","pageview");</script></body></html>
