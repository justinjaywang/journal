It’s been getting colder, though. This morning, the temperature is down to single digits.</p><p>Last weekend, I read <em>Hello, I am Erik</em>, an Erik Spiekermann retrospective.</p><p>My biggest takeaway was that, more than anything, he was a gifted communicator (“You are what you say and how you say it”). Affecting that voice with which you communicate visually is what motivated his work.</p><blockquote><p>I might say that the weather doesn’t interest me. However, it still influences my mood. It’s the same with typography; all cultural expressions influence us. Take buildings, for example: the way they look, how they work. Even if we’re ignorant about architecture, buildings still influence us a lot. The same goes for typography – it influences all of us.</p></blockquote><p>Skylar lent me the book, and he’s been steadily giving me more each week. Along with the office book collection and the nearby Brooklyn Public Library, I feel like I have a wealth of design material to read and learn from, which is a nice feeling to have.</p><p>Other random things:</p><ul><li>In the cold weather, I’ll just be walking and out of nowhere my nose starts to run, full-on dripping down to my mouth. I’d never really experienced that before. Kind of interesting.</li><li>I live right across from a church, and the carillon bells ring on the hour (with an additional soft ring at the half hour). I like that. And at noon and 6pm, they play a tune. Reminds me of the Campanile back in school.</li><li>I started making bread again: yeast breads (mostly sandwich rolls in baguette form) and flatbreads. I’ve also been experimenting with cold dishes, like julienned red bell pepper in olive oil, vinegar, and garlic.</li></ul></section><footer class="post-footer container container--narrow"><ul class="post-tag-list"><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/books/">books</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/cooking/">cooking</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/daily/">daily</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/new-york/">new york</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/reflection/">reflection</a></li></ul></footer></article><article class="post" data-post-id="cikmr8wbz000bjn6tft2ph7gy"><header class="post-header container container--narrow"><a href="/2016/furnishings/"><time class="post-date" datetime="2016-02-14T13:50:08.000Z">Sun, 14 Feb 2016</time><h1 class="post-title">Furnishings</h1></a></header><section class="post-content container container--narrow"><p>I’ve just about finished buying furnishings for my place. I ordered a Japanese futon off Amazon, got half sheet pans and measuring cups from a kitchen supply store in Chinatown, and made an IKEA trip for bedding, slippers, and storage cube things. But I just couldn’t find a suitable bench for my room.</p><p>The one I had at my old place in Emeryville was perfect. I used it as a low table for work and reading as well as for sitting. It was from IKEA, but it’s since been discontinued. I searched for hours (if not days), both in-store and online, but nothing I found matched my taste, and at a price point I was willing to pay. As a result, I continued to use my suitcase as a desk surface to put my laptop on.</p><p>Steve Jobs famously could make buying a sofa into a decade-long ordeal. I can understand that feeling, to a certain extent. Buying furnishings was a big deal for me. And I’d argue that it should be, too, for anyone who cares about the things you surround yourself with on a daily basis. All the stuff I mentioned getting? I spent way too much time deliberating on them before actually deciding. It was a mental drain.</p><p>You can hold out, looking for perfection, but there’s a cost. Speaking generally, life is lived now, in that time spent searching and holding out. Temporary solutions turn permanent. Sometimes you just have to make the best decision given your current options, rather than wait indefinitely for a better one to show up. Because it might not. You have to move on and make the most of what you have.</p><p>So, I finally bit the bullet and picked up a couple of IKEA <a href="http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/20011413/" target="_blank" rel="external">LACK</a> side tables after work on Monday.</p></section><footer class="post-footer container container--narrow"><ul class="post-tag-list"><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/daily/">daily</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/new-york/">new york</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/reflection/">reflection</a></li></ul></footer></article><article class="post" data-post-id="cikmr8wc1000fjn6tsjagaiks"><header class="post-header container container--narrow"><a href="/2016/snowstorm/"><time class="post-date" datetime="2016-01-27T13:40:31.000Z">Wed, 27 Jan 2016</time><h1 class="post-title">Snowstorm</h1></a></header><section class="post-content container container--narrow"><p>I moved into my new apartment north of Prospect Park a couple weeks ago, and I was welcomed with a winter storm this past weekend.

It was nice and relaxing.</p><p>I flew back on Christmas Eve, and read <em>The Shape of Design</em> by Frank Chimero. Jen and Mom picked me up when I arrived and then we ate dumplings for dinner. On Christmas Day, we watched the Warriors–Cavs game while preparing food for dinner later at the Wanninger’s.</p><p>After lunch the next day, Jen and I went shopping and Brendan visited. We had planned to play basketball, but it was too windy so we hung out and watched TV instead. I made a dinner of tomato eggs, string beans with minced pork, and pan-fried tofu.</p><p>On Sunday, I played tennis with Josh at the high school and then made lunch. Dinner that night at Uncle Ray’s. The next few days, I mostly hung out at home, cooking meals for myself and Mom, going on walks, and working on projects.</p><p><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/4291520/journal-images/la-palms.jpg" alt="Palm trees in LA."></p><p>On New Year’s Day, I drove up to LA to visit Byron.

If I happen to wake up and I’m not tired, I’ll just get up and start my day (even if it’s 4:30). I love the feeling of being awake when no one else is. It gives me space, away from noise and chatter, to read, do some work, or reflect.</p><p>For meals, I’ve been keeping it simple, and vegetarian: typically some combination of matchstick potatoes, tomatoes, celery, eggs, leeks, corn, or broccoli stir-fried in sesame oil over rice, seasoned only with salt (though sometimes I’ll add minced garlic or hot peppers, and chopped cilantro to finish). If I’m still hungry, I’ll cook up oatmeal, stir in peanut butter, and top with persimmons or apples.</p><p>I’ve also been seeing an old friend from school, Sneha. We got ramen in Chelsea, walked to Brooklyn Bridge Park, played ping pong, visited <a href="http://www.metmuseum.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">the Met</a>, and have been having discussions on Zen Buddhism. I imagine that’s what people in past would do for entertainment, before movies and other passive activities (not to say I don’t like watching movies, because I do; my favorite part, though, is chatting about them afterwards). What a strange concept, right? To spend your free time on intellectual enrichment.</p><p><a href="http://slbuddhists.org/inanutshell/brahmavihara.html" target="_blank" rel="external">One of the Buddhism-related readings</a> that’s inspired me as of late was recommended by her; other essays and articles I’ve been reading include the usual favorites, like Paul Graham, Oliver Reichenstein, and David Foster Wallace.</p><hr><p>I have to keep reminding myself that happiness lies in the everyday, because it’s easy to think “I’ll be happy when <em>this</em>” or “I’ll be happy when <em>that</em>.”</p><p>And for the first time in a long time, I’m happy with who I am and where I am. In any situation where you’re unhappy, you can either accept it or change it. Anything in between serves no purpose.</p><p>Everywhere I’ve lived up to this point has had some degree of transience. But New York finally feels close to home. It’s diverse, cultured, and walkable. I’ve heard it gets pretty cold in the winter, though, so we’ll see if I still like it in a few months.</p></section><footer class="post-footer container container--narrow"><ul class="post-tag-list"><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/daily/">daily</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/food/">food</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/new-york/">new york</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/reflection/">reflection</a></li></ul></footer></article><article class="post" data-post-id="cikmr8wcf0014jn6t6hy4hzpf"><header class="post-header container container--narrow"><a href="/2015/visiting-home/"><time class="post-date" datetime="2015-11-15T23:21:29.000Z">Sun, 15 Nov 2015</time><h1 class="post-title">Visiting home</h1></a></header><section class="post-content container container--narrow"><p>I arrived in Orange County on Saturday night. Jen happened to be in town for a conference, so she and Mom picked me up at the airport and we went straight to dinner at <a href="http://playgrounddtsa.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Playground</a> in Santa Ana (she had dinner money from Google). The next morning, Mom and I dropped her off at the airport and then relaxed for most of the day. That night, I met up for dinner with Randy, Brian, Josh, Joyce, and Youmi at I-Tea Café in Irvine.</p><p>During the week, I went to the park for walks very early in the morning (I was still on New York time), worked from home, cooked and ate lunches and dinner with Mom, shot hoops in the side yard, changed the car batteries, watched <em>Jeopardy!</em>, went to a job interview, and played guitar and piano. On my last night on Friday, we (minus Brian, plus Nasir) met up at Randy’s after dinner and just chatted.</p><hr><p>Orange County was comforting, and comfortable. I’ll always call it home. But I couldn’t help thinking how dispiriting it’d be to come back and live there. I think the idea of home (and all that comes with it) is always more attractive than the reality of it.</p><p>I also realized on this trip that if producing great work is something I want, I need to be in a place like New York, where I’m constantly being stimulated and challenged, and where there’s a large design community. I was kind of glad to be heading back.</p></section><footer class="post-footer container container--narrow"><ul class="post-tag-list"><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/daily/">daily</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/food/">food</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/new-york/">new york</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/oc/">oc</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/reflection/">reflection</a></li></ul></footer></article><article class="post" data-post-id="cikmr8wcj001ajn6tcy90y4qi"><header class="post-header container container--narrow"><a href="/2015/in-between/"><time class="post-date" datetime="2015-10-31T17:43:24.000Z">Sat, 31 Oct 2015</time><h1 class="post-title">In-between</h1></a></header><section class="post-content container container--narrow"><p>The post-retreat weeks were hectic, mostly because I hadn’t yet found a place to stay. I’m lucky to have friends and family in the city, and a couple of them offered to put me up while I secured a place.</p><p>I got back to the city on Friday and moved into my friends’ place in Stuy Town for the weekend. I went out for drinks later that night with my hosts (one of them was celebrating her birthday) and then met up with Chris to see a stand-up comedy show in the Central Village.</p><p>I didn’t get to sleep much that night, though—one of the friends I was staying with was sick. It got so bad that I had to take her to the hospital early in the morning. Turns out she had a stomach flu and would be OK with some rest, but I spent the better part of the day with one of her roommates running errands and helping to wash her sheets which she’d thrown up on. In the evening, I took it easy and finally got some rest.</p><p>Brian, Youmi, and Leah happened to be in town for the weekend, too. We got Sunday brunch at Cafe Mogador and went thrifting in Williamsburg in the afternoon. That night, I stayed in and watched some TV with my temporary roommates.</p><p>I had the day off on Monday for Columbus Day. I hung out in the apartment in the morning with Carolina, ordered a porchetta sandwich for lunch, and then moved back over to Michael’s in the afternoon.</p><hr><p><strong>That night</strong>, I had bún at a nearby Vietnamese café and made friends with the server, who was from Thailand.</p><p>The work week was good. Since I was staying at Michael’s, I ate out for lunch. I had sandwiches from Num Pang (coconut shrimp, and then bacon and fig), a Vietnamese rice bowl from Saigon Shack, and lu rou fan from Baohaus. I spent evenings visiting apartments. Finding housing became like a second job. I saw a place that I liked on Thursday night in Prospect Heights and decided to later that night to take it after they offered it to me.</p><p>On Friday night, I hung out at home and watched <em>The Voice</em> with Michael and Parilee. The next day, I played basketball in the morning, had lunch at another Vietnamese restaurant, and then moved to an Airbnb, where I’d stay for a few nights before my sublet started.</p><hr><p><strong>The Airbnb</strong> was in Brooklyn’s Bensonhurst, a neighborhood with a large Chinese population. Relocating there would make the move to my new sublet easier on Wednesday. The host was very friendly and chatty.</p><p>I had full access to the kitchen, so for those few days I cooked meals of orzo pasta with celery, eggs, and tomatoes to go with my staple of oatmeal, peanut butter, and fruit (this week, grapes).</p><p>My first night there, I attended my soon-to-be housemates’ housewarming party where I chatted with them and got to meet some of their friends. I think we’ll get along pretty well. They’re all NYU grads from a few years ago. One is an engineer, one is in advertising, and one is a graphic designer.</p><p>The next morning, I met up with Alisha, who was in town visiting. It was chilly, so we grabbed some hot tea on the Upper East Side before taking a stroll in Central Park. After that, I immediately walked over to Uniqlo to buy thermal layers and a beanie.</p><p>After work on Monday and Tuesday, I hung out in my room: I listened to music, watched some shows, and talked with Josh on the phone. Early Wednesday morning, I moved my stuff into the new sublet.</p><hr><p><strong>I chose</strong> the new place for the location, timeframe, room, and people. It’s north of Prospect Park and the Brooklyn Museum, and east of Barclays Center and Downtown Brooklyn. The rent is much cheaper than in Manhattan, for sure, and is very good for the size of the room. My sublease lasts until the end of March, so I’ll have a home through the winter. Moving around is tough.</p><p>I found a new local grocery store, a small 24-hour shop called Mr. Melon, which also makes its own juices and smoothies. Thursday night, I went out for drinks with my new roommates at a beer hall near our apartment called <a href="http://www.bergn.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Berg’n</a>. I was impressed both by its interior design (a large space with long, communal bench tables and an enclosed outdoor patio) and its cocktails (El Duderino, a vegan White Russian).</p><p>On Saturday, I played basketball with the usual gang, had lunch with Byron (who was in town for training at his new job) at <a href="http://www.spicyvillagenyc.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Spicy Village</a> in Chinatown (their big plate of chicken was delicious), and had Vietnamese for dinner with Carolina. I then had a lazy Sunday: I stayed in, took naps, and watched episodes of <em>The Voice</em>, <em>Modern Family</em>, and Anthony Bourdain’s <em>The Layover</em>. I think that I was just exhausted from the past few weeks.</p><p>The next week, work was fine and I was more productive. We’re working on the new version of Siteleaf and are getting ready to invite beta testers. I also had a chat with Skylar about my future at Oak. It was positive—they’d like to continue working with me, and in what capacity is up to me. I said I’d think it over.</p><p>I’m going home to California for the week on Saturday. It’ll be the first time I’ll have been back in a little over three months.</p></section><footer class="post-footer container container--narrow"><ul class="post-tag-list"><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/daily/">daily</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/food/">food</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/new-york/">new york</a></li></ul></footer></article><article class="post" data-post-id="cikmr8wco001ejn6t5p35iqwk"><header class="post-header container container--narrow"><a href="/2015/oakweek/"><time class="post-date" datetime="2015-10-13T00:55:42.000Z">Mon, 12 Oct 2015</time><h1 class="post-title">Oakweek</h1></a></header><section class="post-content container container--narrow"><p>This year for Oak’s annual weeklong retreat, called Oakweek, we drove to a small town called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerhonkson,_New_York" target="_blank" rel="external">Kerhonkson</a>, a few hours north of the city.

When Jen and Brendan arrived, I helped unload stuff and then made a Costco run with Brendan, his dad, and Mike. For lunch, I had dry-fried green beans over rice at the Asian Ghetto. In the evening, we had rehearsal at the stadium and then dinner with family and friends at Angeline’s.</p><p>Saturday was filled with helping for the wedding, pictures for the wedding, the wedding itself, and more helping for the wedding. I ate leftover jambalaya from Angeline’s in the morning, then leftover baby back ribs for lunch. The venue was beautiful, the ceremony and reception went smoothly, and everyone seemed to have a good time.</p><p>I saw Jason early the next morning; we drove to a diner on 4th Street for breakfast and then chatted for a bit afterwards. Back at the hotel, I helped load up the remaining items as people checked out and went their separate ways. After lunch at Long Life Vegi house in downtown Berkeley with Mom and Dad, I traveled with Mom down to Jen’s place in San Jose. We ate at a Taiwanese restaurant for dinner, then dropped Mom off at the airport. I stayed over at Jen and Brendan’s that night. We hung out, just like old times, and I met the newest member of the family, their dog Zucchi.</p><p>The next day, the three of us drove to Berkeley to meet Dad for lunch at Turkish Kitchen. I walked with Dad around campus in the afternoon; in the evening, I had bún again with Dad and then headed to the airport.</p></section><footer class="post-footer container container--narrow"><ul class="post-tag-list"><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/berkeley/">berkeley</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/family/">family</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/food/">food</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/vacation/">vacation</a></li></ul></footer></article></main><footer class="page-footer"><nav class="nav nav--pagination"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="nav-item"></li><li class="nav-item"><a href="/page/2/" class="nav-link nav-link--center">1 of 15</a></li><li class="nav-item"><a href="/page/2/" class="nav-link">Next</a></li></ul></nav></footer><script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.0.3/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/js/all.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">!function(e,a,t,n,c,o,s){e.GoogleAnalyticsObject=c,e[c]=e[c]||function(){(e[c].q=e[c].q||[]).push(arguments)},e[c].l=1*new Date,o=a.createElement(t),s=a.getElementsByTagName(t)[0],o.async=1,o.src=n,s.parentNode.insertBefore(o,s)}(window,document,"script","//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js","ga"),ga("create","UA-15132368-5","auto"),ga("send","pageview");</script></body></html>
