It was nice and relaxing.</p><p>I flew back on Christmas Eve, and read <em>The Shape of Design</em> by Frank Chimero. Jen and Mom picked me up when I arrived and then we ate dumplings for dinner. On Christmas Day, we watched the Warriors–Cavs game while preparing food for dinner later at the Wanninger’s.</p><p>After lunch the next day, Jen and I went shopping and Brendan visited. We had planned to play basketball, but it was too windy so we hung out and watched TV instead. I made a dinner of tomato eggs, string beans with minced pork, and pan-fried tofu.</p><p>On Sunday, I played tennis with Josh at the high school and then made lunch. Dinner that night at Uncle Ray’s. The next few days, I mostly hung out at home, cooking meals for myself and Mom, going on walks, and working on projects.</p><p><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/4291520/journal-images/la-palms.jpg" alt="Palm trees in LA."></p><p>On New Year’s Day, I drove up to LA to visit Byron. We spent the day exploring the city with Amy and Vanessa. Highlights included the Griffith Observatory, and dinner and bowling in Koreatown.</p><p>I spent the remainder of the weekend relaxing (such as re-watching <em>Garden State</em>) before working remotely the last week I was home. On my last night, I got dinner with Randy, Josh, Joyce, and Brian at Souplantation (Randy and Brian had just got back from their Asia trip). We hung out at Youmi’s afterwards.</p></section><footer class="post-footer container container--narrow"><ul class="post-tag-list"><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/books/">books</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/daily/">daily</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/food/">food</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/los-angeles/">los angeles</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/movies/">movies</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/oc/">oc</a></li></ul></footer></article><article class="post" data-post-id="cik1p1a97000ndlxq5uao7rha"><header class="post-header container container--narrow"><a href="/2015/fall-s-end/"><time class="post-date" datetime="2015-12-20T14:14:42.000Z">Sun, 20 Dec 2015</time><h1 class="post-title">Fall&#39;s end</h1></a></header><section class="post-content container container--narrow"><p>After I decided to take the offer of full-time at Oak, I’ve gotten into a rhythm of working, cooking, reading, going on walks, exploring the city, playing basketball, and seeing friends.</p><p>I’ve been waking up super early, too. If I happen to wake up and I’m not tired, I’ll just get up and start my day (even if it’s 4:30). I love the feeling of being awake when no one else is. It gives me space, away from noise and chatter, to read, do some work, or reflect.</p><p>For meals, I’ve been keeping it simple, and vegetarian: typically some combination of matchstick potatoes, tomatoes, celery, eggs, leeks, corn, or broccoli stir-fried in sesame oil over rice, seasoned only with salt (though sometimes I’ll add minced garlic or hot peppers, and chopped cilantro to finish). If I’m still hungry, I’ll cook up oatmeal, stir in peanut butter, and top with persimmons or apples.</p><p>I’ve also been seeing an old friend from school, Sneha. We got ramen in Chelsea, walked to Brooklyn Bridge Park, played ping pong, visited <a href="http://www.metmuseum.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">the Met</a>, and have been having discussions on Zen Buddhism. I imagine that’s what people in past would do for entertainment, before movies and other passive activities (not to say I don’t like watching movies, because I do; my favorite part, though, is chatting about them afterwards). What a strange concept, right? To spend your free time on intellectual enrichment.</p><p><a href="http://slbuddhists.org/inanutshell/brahmavihara.html" target="_blank" rel="external">One of the Buddhism-related readings</a> that’s inspired me as of late was recommended by her; other essays and articles I’ve been reading include the usual favorites, like Paul Graham, Oliver Reichenstein, and David Foster Wallace.</p><hr><p>I have to keep reminding myself that happiness lies in the everyday, because it’s easy to think “I’ll be happy when <em>this</em>” or “I’ll be happy when <em>that</em>.”</p><p>And for the first time in a long time, I’m happy with who I am and where I am. In any situation where you’re unhappy, you can either accept it or change it. Anything in between serves no purpose.</p><p>Everywhere I’ve lived up to this point has had some degree of transience. But New York finally feels close to home. It’s diverse, cultured, and walkable. I’ve heard it gets pretty cold in the winter, though, so we’ll see if I still like it in a few months.</p></section><footer class="post-footer container container--narrow"><ul class="post-tag-list"><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/daily/">daily</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/food/">food</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/new-york/">new york</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/reflection/">reflection</a></li></ul></footer></article><article class="post" data-post-id="cik1p1a9a000sdlxqml0w7q9c"><header class="post-header container container--narrow"><a href="/2015/visiting-home/"><time class="post-date" datetime="2015-11-15T23:21:29.000Z">Sun, 15 Nov 2015</time><h1 class="post-title">Visiting home</h1></a></header><section class="post-content container container--narrow"><p>I arrived in Orange County on Saturday night. Jen happened to be in town for a conference, so she and Mom picked me up at the airport and we went straight to dinner at <a href="http://playgrounddtsa.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Playground</a> in Santa Ana (she had dinner money from Google). The next morning, Mom and I dropped her off at the airport and then relaxed for most of the day. That night, I met up for dinner with Randy, Brian, Josh, Joyce, and Youmi at I-Tea Café in Irvine.</p><p>During the week, I went to the park for walks very early in the morning (I was still on New York time), worked from home, cooked and ate lunches and dinner with Mom, shot hoops in the side yard, changed the car batteries, watched <em>Jeopardy!</em>, went to a job interview, and played guitar and piano. On my last night on Friday, we (minus Brian, plus Nasir) met up at Randy’s after dinner and just chatted.</p><hr><p>Orange County was comforting, and comfortable. I’ll always call it home. But I couldn’t help thinking how dispiriting it’d be to come back and live there. I think the idea of home (and all that comes with it) is always more attractive than the reality of it.</p><p>I also realized on this trip that if producing great work is something I want, I need to be in a place like New York, where I’m constantly being stimulated and challenged, and where there’s a large design community. I was kind of glad to be heading back.</p></section><footer class="post-footer container container--narrow"><ul class="post-tag-list"><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/daily/">daily</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/food/">food</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/new-york/">new york</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/oc/">oc</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/reflection/">reflection</a></li></ul></footer></article><article class="post" data-post-id="cik1p1a9e000ydlxqr2lgiugl"><header class="post-header container container--narrow"><a href="/2015/in-between/"><time class="post-date" datetime="2015-10-31T17:43:24.000Z">Sat, 31 Oct 2015</time><h1 class="post-title">In-between</h1></a></header><section class="post-content container container--narrow"><p>The post-retreat weeks were hectic, mostly because I hadn’t yet found a place to stay. I’m lucky to have friends and family in the city, and a couple of them offered to put me up while I secured a place.</p><p>I got back to the city on Friday and moved into my friends’ place in Stuy Town for the weekend. I went out for drinks later that night with my hosts (one of them was celebrating her birthday) and then met up with Chris to see a stand-up comedy show in the Central Village.</p><p>I didn’t get to sleep much that night, though—one of the friends I was staying with was sick. It got so bad that I had to take her to the hospital early in the morning. Turns out she had a stomach flu and would be OK with some rest, but I spent the better part of the day with one of her roommates running errands and helping to wash her sheets which she’d thrown up on. In the evening, I took it easy and finally got some rest.</p><p>Brian, Youmi, and Leah happened to be in town for the weekend, too. We got Sunday brunch at Cafe Mogador and went thrifting in Williamsburg in the afternoon. That night, I stayed in and watched some TV with my temporary roommates.</p><p>I had the day off on Monday for Columbus Day. I hung out in the apartment in the morning with Carolina, ordered a porchetta sandwich for lunch, and then moved back over to Michael’s in the afternoon.</p><hr><p><strong>That night</strong>, I had bún at a nearby Vietnamese café and made friends with the server, who was from Thailand.</p><p>The work week was good. Since I was staying at Michael’s, I ate out for lunch. I had sandwiches from Num Pang (coconut shrimp, and then bacon and fig), a Vietnamese rice bowl from Saigon Shack, and lu rou fan from Baohaus. I spent evenings visiting apartments. Finding housing became like a second job. I saw a place that I liked on Thursday night in Prospect Heights and decided to later that night to take it after they offered it to me.</p><p>On Friday night, I hung out at home and watched <em>The Voice</em> with Michael and Parilee. The next day, I played basketball in the morning, had lunch at another Vietnamese restaurant, and then moved to an Airbnb, where I’d stay for a few nights before my sublet started.</p><hr><p><strong>The Airbnb</strong> was in Brooklyn’s Bensonhurst, a neighborhood with a large Chinese population. Relocating there would make the move to my new sublet easier on Wednesday. The host was very friendly and chatty.</p><p>I had full access to the kitchen, so for those few days I cooked meals of orzo pasta with celery, eggs, and tomatoes to go with my staple of oatmeal, peanut butter, and fruit (this week, grapes).</p><p>My first night there, I attended my soon-to-be housemates’ housewarming party where I chatted with them and got to meet some of their friends. I think we’ll get along pretty well. They’re all NYU grads from a few years ago. One is an engineer, one is in advertising, and one is a graphic designer.</p><p>The next morning, I met up with Alisha, who was in town visiting. It was chilly, so we grabbed some hot tea on the Upper East Side before taking a stroll in Central Park. After that, I immediately walked over to Uniqlo to buy thermal layers and a beanie.</p><p>After work on Monday and Tuesday, I hung out in my room: I listened to music, watched some shows, and talked with Josh on the phone. Early Wednesday morning, I moved my stuff into the new sublet.</p><hr><p><strong>I chose</strong> the new place for the location, timeframe, room, and people. It’s north of Prospect Park and the Brooklyn Museum, and east of Barclays Center and Downtown Brooklyn. The rent is much cheaper than in Manhattan, for sure, and is very good for the size of the room. My sublease lasts until the end of March, so I’ll have a home through the winter. Moving around is tough.</p><p>I found a new local grocery store, a small 24-hour shop called Mr. Melon, which also makes its own juices and smoothies. Thursday night, I went out for drinks with my new roommates at a beer hall near our apartment called <a href="http://www.bergn.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Berg’n</a>. I was impressed both by its interior design (a large space with long, communal bench tables and an enclosed outdoor patio) and its cocktails (El Duderino, a vegan White Russian).</p><p>On Saturday, I played basketball with the usual gang, had lunch with Byron (who was in town for training at his new job) at <a href="http://www.spicyvillagenyc.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Spicy Village</a> in Chinatown (their big plate of chicken was delicious), and had Vietnamese for dinner with Carolina. I then had a lazy Sunday: I stayed in, took naps, and watched episodes of <em>The Voice</em>, <em>Modern Family</em>, and Anthony Bourdain’s <em>The Layover</em>. I think that I was just exhausted from the past few weeks.</p><p>The next week, work was fine and I was more productive. We’re working on the new version of Siteleaf and are getting ready to invite beta testers. I also had a chat with Skylar about my future at Oak. It was positive—they’d like to continue working with me, and in what capacity is up to me. I said I’d think it over.</p><p>I’m going home to California for the week on Saturday. It’ll be the first time I’ll have been back in a little over three months.</p></section><footer class="post-footer container container--narrow"><ul class="post-tag-list"><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/daily/">daily</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/food/">food</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/new-york/">new york</a></li></ul></footer></article><article class="post" data-post-id="cik1p1a9h0012dlxqmqzv9lv4"><header class="post-header container container--narrow"><a href="/2015/oakweek/"><time class="post-date" datetime="2015-10-13T00:55:42.000Z">Mon, 12 Oct 2015</time><h1 class="post-title">Oakweek</h1></a></header><section class="post-content container container--narrow"><p>This year for Oak’s annual weeklong retreat, called Oakweek, we drove to a small town called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerhonkson,_New_York" target="_blank" rel="external">Kerhonkson</a>, a few hours north of the city.

When Jen and Brendan arrived, I helped unload stuff and then made a Costco run with Brendan, his dad, and Mike. For lunch, I had dry-fried green beans over rice at the Asian Ghetto. In the evening, we had rehearsal at the stadium and then dinner with family and friends at Angeline’s.</p><p>Saturday was filled with helping for the wedding, pictures for the wedding, the wedding itself, and more helping for the wedding. I ate leftover jambalaya from Angeline’s in the morning, then leftover baby back ribs for lunch.

Back at the hotel, I helped load up the remaining items as people checked out and went their separate ways. After lunch at Long Life Vegi house in downtown Berkeley with Mom and Dad, I traveled with Mom down to Jen’s place in San Jose.

The project I’d been working for the last month and a half shipped on Tuesday, so I was focused on getting everything done in time. I put in extra hours in the mornings and evenings working from home, and a good chunk of the long weekend was spent in front of my laptop. I didn’t mind at all, though, since it’s work I like to do. It was exhilarating. I hadn’t felt that way since back in school.</p><p>I’m proud of the end result. We all became experts in a framework and language that were completely new to us at the start. I learned a lot of lessons on this project, too—don’t take shortcuts (they always catch up to you), don’t settle for a hack, and be patient and deliberate.</p><p>On top of this, I moved apartments in the middle of the week. What little time I had not working was spent getting set up and settled into my new place. Funny story, actually:</p><p>I met my new roommates Monday night to get the keys, and my new roommate Justin helped me move the couch from my old apartment. Afterwards, I went for a walk around the complex and ended up helping two other people move in in separate instances (I was already sweaty, so it was fine). The first person I helped because the mover offered me 20 bucks help him carry large furniture. I was about to head home after that when I passed by another person with a bunch of luggage who looked lost, so I offered to help. When she was able to track down her roommates, they came down and we all helped carry her stuff up to the apartment.</p><p>I didn’t have time to get groceries and cook, so I ate out for lunch during the latter half of the week after I moved. I had cold-skin noodles, bánh mì ga, and a Cambodian coconut shrimp sandwich.</p><p>I played basketball in Brooklyn again on Saturday—it’s something I look forward to every week. Later that night, the girl who I helped move earlier in the week and her roommates invited me over for dinner. I stopped by again on Sunday and Monday (Labor Day) to help them build IKEA furniture, and they treated me to dinner on Monday night.</p><p>Sunday, I finally saw Michael again, for Tibetan noodles in Jackson Heights, Queens. Monday morning, I walked to Chinatown for groceries and cooked a pot of lu rou for lunch.</p></section><footer class="post-footer container container--narrow"><ul class="post-tag-list"><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/daily/">daily</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/food/">food</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/labor-day/">labor day</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/new-york/">new york</a></li></ul></footer></article></main><footer class="page-footer"><nav class="nav nav--pagination"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="nav-item"></li><li class="nav-item"><a href="/page/2/" class="nav-link nav-link--center">1 of 15</a></li><li class="nav-item"><a href="/page/2/" class="nav-link">Next</a></li></ul></nav></footer><script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.0.3/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/js/all.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">!function(e,a,t,n,c,o,s){e.GoogleAnalyticsObject=c,e[c]=e[c]||function(){(e[c].q=e[c].q||[]).push(arguments)},e[c].l=1*new Date,o=a.createElement(t),s=a.getElementsByTagName(t)[0],o.async=1,o.src=n,s.parentNode.insertBefore(o,s)}(window,document,"script","//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js","ga"),ga("create","UA-15132368-5","auto"),ga("send","pageview");</script></body></html>
