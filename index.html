It’s been getting colder, though. This morning, the temperature’s down to single digits.</p><p>Last weekend, I read <em>Hello, I am Erik</em>, an Erik Spiekermann retrospective.</p><p>My biggest takeaway was that, more than anything, he was a gifted communicator (“You are what you say and how you say it”). Affecting that voice with which you communicate visually is what motivated his work.</p><blockquote><p>I might say that the weather doesn’t interest me. However, it still influences my mood. It’s the same with typography; all cultural expressions influence us. Take buildings, for example: the way they look, how they work. Even if we’re ignorant about architecture, buildings still influence us a lot. The same goes for typography – it influences all of us.</p></blockquote><p>Skylar lent me the book, and he’s been giving me more each week. Along with the office book collection and the nearby Brooklyn Public Library, I feel like I have a wealth of design material to read and learn from, which is a nice feeling to have.</p><p>Other things:</p><ul><li>With the cold weather, I’ll just be walking and out of nowhere my nose starts to run, full-on dripping down to my mouth. I’d never really experienced that before. Kind of interesting.</li><li>I live right across from a church, and its bells ring the number of hours on the hour (with an additional soft ring at the half hour). I like that. And at noon and 6pm, they play a tune. Reminds me of the Campanile back in school.</li><li>I started making bread again: yeast breads (mostly sandwich rolls in baguette form) and flatbreads. I’ve also been experimenting with cold dishes, like julienned red bell pepper in olive oil, vinegar, and garlic.</li></ul></section><footer class="post-footer container container--narrow"><ul class="post-tag-list"><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/books/">books</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/cooking/">cooking</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/daily/">daily</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/new-york/">new york</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/reflection/">reflection</a></li></ul></footer></article><article class="post" data-post-id="cimkrxvd5000o6cc9gv9dwuw0"><header class="post-header container container--narrow"><a href="/2016/furnishings/"><time class="post-date" datetime="2016-02-14T13:50:08.000Z">Sun, 14 Feb 2016</time><h1 class="post-title">Furnishings</h1></a></header><section class="post-content container container--narrow"><p>I’ve just about finished buying furnishings for my place. I ordered a Japanese futon off Amazon, got half sheet pans and measuring cups from a kitchen supply store in Chinatown, and made an IKEA trip for bedding, slippers, and storage cube things. But I just couldn’t find a suitable bench for my room.</p><p>The one I had at my old place in Emeryville was perfect. I used it as a low table for work and reading as well as for sitting. It was from IKEA, but it’s since been discontinued. I searched for hours (if not days), both in-store and online, but nothing I found matched my taste, and at a price point I was willing to pay. As a result, I continued to use my suitcase as a desk surface to put my laptop on.</p><p>Steve Jobs famously could make buying a sofa into a decade-long ordeal. I can understand that feeling, to a certain extent. Buying furnishings was a big deal for me. And I’d argue that it should be, too, for anyone who cares about the things you surround yourself with on a daily basis. All the stuff I mentioned getting? I spent way too much time deliberating on them before actually deciding. It was a mental drain.</p><p>Speaking generally, you can hold out, looking for perfection, but at a cost. Life is lived in that time spent searching and holding out. Temporary solutions turn permanent. Sometimes you just have to make the best decision given your current options, rather than wait for a better one to show up. Because it might not.</p><p>I bit the bullet and picked up two <a href="http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/20011413/" target="_blank" rel="external">LACK</a> side tables from IKEA after work on Monday.</p></section><footer class="post-footer container container--narrow"><ul class="post-tag-list"><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/daily/">daily</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/new-york/">new york</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/reflection/">reflection</a></li></ul></footer></article><article class="post" data-post-id="cimkrxvd9000s6cc9b5k0lbid"><header class="post-header container container--narrow"><a href="/2016/snowstorm/"><time class="post-date" datetime="2016-01-27T13:40:31.000Z">Wed, 27 Jan 2016</time><h1 class="post-title">Snowstorm</h1></a></header><section class="post-content container container--narrow"><p>I moved into my new apartment north of Prospect Park a couple weeks ago, and I was welcomed with a winter storm this past weekend.

I felt trapped and I didn’t like it. The one time I did leave the house, on Sunday afternoon to get groceries in Chinatown, a number of trains weren’t running, and walking was difficult since the sidewalks were covered with snow.

It was nice and relaxing.</p><p>I flew back on Christmas Eve, and read <em>The Shape of Design</em> by Frank Chimero. Jen and Mom picked me up when I arrived and then we ate dumplings for dinner. On Christmas Day, we watched the Warriors–Cavs game while preparing food for dinner later at the Wanninger’s.</p><p>After lunch the next day, Jen and I went shopping and Brendan visited. We had planned to play basketball, but it was too windy so we hung out and watched TV instead. I made a dinner of tomato eggs, string beans with minced pork, and pan-fried tofu.</p><p>On Sunday, I played tennis with Josh at the high school and then made lunch. Dinner that night at Uncle Ray’s. The next few days, I mostly hung out at home, cooking meals for myself and Mom, going on walks, and working on projects.</p><p><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/4291520/journal-images/la-palms.jpg" alt="Palm trees in LA."></p><p>On New Year’s Day, I drove up to LA to visit Byron. We spent the day exploring the city with Amy and Vanessa. Highlights included the Griffith Observatory, and dinner and bowling in Koreatown.</p><p>I spent the remainder of the weekend relaxing (such as re-watching <em>Garden State</em>) before working remotely the last week I was home. On my last night, I got dinner with Randy, Josh, Joyce, and Brian at Souplantation (Randy and Brian had just got back from their Asia trip).

If I happen to wake up and I’m not tired, I’ll just get up and start my day (even if it’s 4:30). I love the feeling of being awake when no one else is. It gives me space, away from noise and chatter, to read, do some work, or reflect.</p><p>For meals, I’ve been keeping it simple, and vegetarian: typically some combination of matchstick potatoes, tomatoes, celery, eggs, leeks, corn, or broccoli stir-fried in sesame oil over rice, seasoned only with salt (though sometimes I’ll add minced garlic or hot peppers, and chopped cilantro to finish). If I’m still hungry, I’ll cook up oatmeal, stir in peanut butter, and top with persimmons or apples.</p><p>I’ve also been seeing an old friend from school, Sneha. We got ramen in Chelsea, walked to Brooklyn Bridge Park, played ping pong, visited <a href="http://www.metmuseum.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">the Met</a>, and have been having discussions on Zen Buddhism. I imagine that’s what people in past would do for entertainment, before movies and other passive activities (not to say I don’t like watching movies, because I do; my favorite part, though, is chatting about them afterwards). What a strange concept, right? To spend your free time on intellectual enrichment.</p><p><a href="http://slbuddhists.org/inanutshell/brahmavihara.html" target="_blank" rel="external">One of the Buddhism-related readings</a> that’s inspired me as of late was recommended by her; other essays and articles I’ve been reading include the usual favorites, like Paul Graham, Oliver Reichenstein, and David Foster Wallace.</p><hr><p>I have to keep reminding myself that happiness lies in the everyday, because it’s easy to think “I’ll be happy when <em>this</em>” or “I’ll be happy when <em>that</em>.”</p><p>And for the first time in a long time, I’m happy with who I am and where I am. In any situation where you’re unhappy, you can either accept it or change it. Anything in between serves no purpose.</p><p>Everywhere I’ve lived up to this point has had some degree of transience. But New York finally feels close to home. It’s diverse, cultured, and walkable. I’ve heard it gets pretty cold in the winter, though, so we’ll see if I still like it in a few months.</p></section><footer class="post-footer container container--narrow"><ul class="post-tag-list"><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/daily/">daily</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/food/">food</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/new-york/">new york</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/reflection/">reflection</a></li></ul></footer></article><article class="post" data-post-id="cimkrxvdy001l6cc91r0fgkdw"><header class="post-header container container--narrow"><a href="/2015/visiting-home/"><time class="post-date" datetime="2015-11-15T23:21:29.000Z">Sun, 15 Nov 2015</time><h1 class="post-title">Visiting home</h1></a></header><section class="post-content container container--narrow"><p>I arrived in Orange County on Saturday night. Jen happened to be in town for a conference, so she and Mom picked me up at the airport and we went straight to dinner at <a href="http://playgrounddtsa.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Playground</a> in Santa Ana (she had dinner money from Google). The next morning, Mom and I dropped her off at the airport and then relaxed for most of the day. That night, I met up for dinner with Randy, Brian, Josh, Joyce, and Youmi at I-Tea Café in Irvine.</p><p>During the week, I went to the park for walks very early in the morning (I was still on New York time), worked from home, cooked and ate lunches and dinner with Mom, shot hoops in the side yard, changed the car batteries, watched <em>Jeopardy!</em>, went to a job interview, and played guitar and piano. On my last night on Friday, we (minus Brian, plus Nasir) met up at Randy’s after dinner and just chatted.</p><hr><p>Orange County was comforting, and comfortable. I’ll always call it home. But I couldn’t help thinking how dispiriting it’d be to come back and live there. I think the idea of home (and all that comes with it) is always more attractive than the reality of it.</p><p>I also realized on this trip that if producing great work is something I want, I need to be in a place like New York, where I’m constantly being stimulated and challenged, and where there’s a large design community. I was kind of glad to be heading back.</p></section><footer class="post-footer container container--narrow"><ul class="post-tag-list"><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/daily/">daily</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/food/">food</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/new-york/">new york</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/oc/">oc</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/reflection/">reflection</a></li></ul></footer></article></main><footer class="page-footer"><nav class="nav nav--pagination"><ul class="nav-list"><li class="nav-item"></li><li class="nav-item"><a href="/page/2/" class="nav-link nav-link--center">1 of 16</a></li><li class="nav-item"><a href="/page/2/" class="nav-link">Next</a></li></ul></nav></footer><script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.0.3/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/js/all.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">!function(e,a,t,n,c,o,s){e.GoogleAnalyticsObject=c,e[c]=e[c]||function(){(e[c].q=e[c].q||[]).push(arguments)},e[c].l=1*new Date,o=a.createElement(t),s=a.getElementsByTagName(t)[0],o.async=1,o.src=n,s.parentNode.insertBefore(o,s)}(window,document,"script","//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js","ga"),ga("create","UA-15132368-5","auto"),ga("send","pageview");</script></body></html>
