My mindset was: <em>work hard, get through school, find a job, and you’ll be happy</em>. As long as I earned a stable income, a job was just a job.</p><p>As it turns out, that was a very narrow outlook. Happiness, after all, lies in your day-to-day experience. How you’re spending time on a routine workday matters just as much as when you’re on vacation. My mindset now is: <em>find a job you love</em>. This means doing work that’s meaningful and rewarding, and with people I like being around.</p><p>I have a lot of skills and interests. But I realize that I can’t pursue everything I’m interested in—there’s just not enough time. The way our society is set up, it’s optimal to choose one profession, and learn to do it well.</p><p>Choosing the right path is hard. Only a select few get it right on their first try. For most people, it takes considerable exploration to find your purpose.</p><p>For me, when I look at the big picture, what is it that really separates me from other people? It’s my creative ability. Always has been, ever since I was little. I’d be doing a disservice to myself by working at a place where I’m not able to fully exercise this. Creativity needs to be nurtured, or it will diminish. I felt that happening last year, so I got off the train.</p><p>There will always be a bias towards choosing certain careers for monetary reasons or because of perceived status. They’re factors, for sure; no one can deny that. But they shouldn’t drive your intentions.</p><p>I’ll no longer do something just because it’s what’s expected of me. Because in that case, I’d be living someone else’s life, and not my own.</p></section><footer class="post-footer container container--narrow"><ul class="post-tag-list"><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/reflection/">reflection</a></li></ul></footer></article><script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.0.3/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/js/all.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">!function(e,a,t,n,c,o,s){e.GoogleAnalyticsObject=c,e[c]=e[c]||function(){(e[c].q=e[c].q||[]).push(arguments)},e[c].l=1*new Date,o=a.createElement(t),s=a.getElementsByTagName(t)[0],o.async=1,o.src=n,s.parentNode.insertBefore(o,s)}(window,document,"script","//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js","ga"),ga("create","UA-15132368-6","auto"),ga("send","pageview");</script></body></html>
