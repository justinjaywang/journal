We ate meals, played sports, and sang karaoke together. I saw where they lived and where they worked. And I saw their favorite hangout spots. As a result, I feel I have a much better sense of the local culture than I would have otherwise. Plus, now I have friends in the Philippines, which is pretty cool.</li><li>Being away from the social world of back home was a breath of fresh air. I saw how liberating it can be to not care what anyone thinks. There was no reason to be self-conscious or shy, especially since everyone was so warm, flattering, and engaging—they were so excited when they first met me. Just be you, and you’ll have fun.</li><li>Seeing the infrastructure there and the way certain things operate gives me more of an appreciation for things that I’ve probably taken for granted, growing up where I have. They’re simple things, like: the ability to walk around a city and feel safe, clean air, people that actually try to help you if you ask a question, and service workers that give any shit. Just to name a few.</li><li>Don’t take parents for granted. While I still can, I should get to know Dad as much as possible (especially times when we’re on the same continent). During this trip, I came a little closer to understanding some of his motivations. We’re alike in a lot of ways; learning about him is partly learning about myself also.</li><li>I’m fortunate for what I have. Not only did I have the means to travel to a foreign country—which not a lot of people in the world can claim—but I had the time away from work to do so via the freedom to quit my job and be selective with my career. I know I’m spoiled in many ways. The best I can do, then, is try to be happy and show appreciation to those who have worked hard to put me in this situation.</li></ol></section><footer class="post-footer container container--narrow"><ul class="post-tag-list"><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/philippines/">philippines</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/reflection/">reflection</a></li></ul></footer></article><script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.0.3/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/js/all.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">!function(e,a,t,n,c,o,s){e.GoogleAnalyticsObject=c,e[c]=e[c]||function(){(e[c].q=e[c].q||[]).push(arguments)},e[c].l=1*new Date,o=a.createElement(t),s=a.getElementsByTagName(t)[0],o.async=1,o.src=n,s.parentNode.insertBefore(o,s)}(window,document,"script","//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js","ga"),ga("create","UA-15132368-6","auto"),ga("send","pageview");</script></body></html>
