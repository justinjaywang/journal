I flew in the night of the 19th and started work the next morning. My flight was delayed too, so I ended up having to take a cab just to arrive at Michael and Parilee’s apartment before 11pm. I remember being so tired and sleep-deprived those first few days, yet I had to figure everything out on the go. It was a bit of a culture shock at first, but I’ve adjusted.</p><p>The internship has been good, overall. The guys are super laid back, and I have a ton of freedom. Plus, they all have great taste and work on useful projects. The office is in Union Square, so there’s a ton of lunch options nearby (<a href="http://taboonette.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Taboonette</a> and <a href="http://numpangnyc.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Num Pang</a> are right around the corner).</p><p>While staying at Michael and Parilee’s, I’d take the subway to work in the mornings; in the evenings, I occasionally opted to walk home. It’s a long walk (about an hour and a half to the Upper East Side), but there’s no better way to see the city. Along the way, I passed by places like Rockefeller Center, the Empire State Building, and Times Square. Sometimes I’d stop in Central Park, eat a light dinner that I packed, and people-watch. On my first day off on Saturday, I explored Chinatown in the morning and got <em>ji tui fan</em> for lunch.</p><p>I’ve seen some friends while I’ve been here, too. Akina introduced me to <a href="http://xianfoods.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Xi’an Famous Foods</a>, and I’ve already been back to eat there multiple times (their cold-skin noodles have been the best thing I’ve eaten here so far). Laura was in town, too. I hung out with her in Brooklyn on Saturday; we saw the Brooklyn Museum with Kelly, strolled through Prospect Park with Dmitry, and then had dinner and drinks. I also had dinner the following week (soba in SoHo) with Carolyn, who I also knew from school.</p><p>This past Saturday, I played basketball in the morning with Dmitry in Crown Heights. I moved into my sublet in the East Village later that afternoon. I crammed into a crowded subway car and then labored down 14th Street carrying my stuff. The place was a mess when I arrived, but I’ve been slowly cleaning and making it feel like a home, somewhat. That night, I returned to Brooklyn for Dmitry’s house party, and I saw even more people from Berkeley, like McKenna and Isi.</p></section><footer class="post-footer container container--narrow"><ul class="post-tag-list"><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/daily/">daily</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/food/">food</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/new-york/">new york</a></li></ul></footer></article><script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.0.3/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/js/all.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">!function(e,a,t,n,c,o,s){e.GoogleAnalyticsObject=c,e[c]=e[c]||function(){(e[c].q=e[c].q||[]).push(arguments)},e[c].l=1*new Date,o=a.createElement(t),s=a.getElementsByTagName(t)[0],o.async=1,o.src=n,s.parentNode.insertBefore(o,s)}(window,document,"script","//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js","ga"),ga("create","UA-15132368-5","auto"),ga("send","pageview");</script></body></html>
