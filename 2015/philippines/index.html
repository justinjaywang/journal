Dinner at <em>Casa Verde</em> for spare ribs and roasted chicken.</p><p><strong>Friday</strong>—At the office for most of the day. Volleyball in the evening. After dinner at home, Dad and I attended a company party at the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Crown+Regency+Residences+Cebu/@10.3185,123.885,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x33a99ecc616da429:0x21c897fd84fba463" target="_blank" rel="external">Crown Regency</a>, where there was a bar and karaoke. I made plans with some of the employees to go out on Sunday for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinulog" target="_blank" rel="external">Sinulog</a> festival.</p><p><strong>Saturday</strong>—Trip to the Filipino Costco, called S&amp;R, in the morning. It was interesting seeing what produce and products they had for sale. Basketball in the evening, then dumplings for dinner.</p><p><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/4291520/journal-images/philippines-2.jpg" alt="Seafood for sale at S&amp;R."></p><p><strong>Sunday</strong>—Met up with my new friends in the late morning to attend the Sinulog festivities. We watched the parade from a grandstand while I tried some new foods, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokneneng" target="_blank" rel="external">kwek kwek</a> and green mango dipped in shrimp paste. Afterwards, we walked around and most of them got their faces painted.</p><p>For dinner, we ate lechón belly with puso (hanging rice) and a glass of Coke. More wandering around after dinner. The scene was surreal. By then, the sun had gone down and the streets became the setting for one huge rave. I made it out, but not without a paint-covered face to show for it. The final stop of the night was karaoke, which was the highlight of the entire day. At midnight, we rode a jeepney back to City Lights and they walked me to the gate.</p><p><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/4291520/journal-images/philippines-3.jpg" alt="Making our way through the crowded streets."><br><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/4291520/journal-images/philippines-4.jpg" alt="Paint-covered Sinulog-goers."></p><p><strong>Monday</strong>—Walked around one of Cebu’s giant malls, Ayala. Shot some hoops downstairs. For dinner, we had some more Filipino cuisine: crispy pata, mongo soup, and kare-kare.</p><p><strong>Tuesday</strong>—Dad and I took a short trip to the recently-opened CallTek office in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Santos" target="_blank" rel="external">General Santos</a>. Lunch at a café near the hotel, consisting of Filipino fare: tuna sisig, chicken adobo, and pinakbet. Afterwards, we scoured the malls, looking for furniture and appliances for the new office. Dinner: crab and grilled tuna belly.</p><p><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/4291520/journal-images/philippines-5.jpg" alt="GenSan&#39;s main highway."><br><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/4291520/journal-images/philippines-6.jpg" alt="Riding on a tricycle, GenSan&#39;s primary mode of public transport."></p><p><strong>Wednesday</strong>—In the early morning, I met some more company people over breakfast at McDonald’s—they’re over in GenSan training new employees. We also had dinner together, a seafood feast at Tiongson Arcade: grilled tuna jaw, tuna roe, fried calamari, lechón kawali with julienned green mango, and shrimp sinigang.</p><p><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/4291520/journal-images/philippines-7.jpg" alt="Seafood at Tiongson Arcade. The tuna jaw was especially good."><br><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/4291520/journal-images/philippines-8.jpg" alt="More karaoke, at the mall after dinner."></p><p><strong>Thursday</strong>—Got breakfast with Shontel, Aubrey, Maegan, and Cathy and hung out at their place afterwards before heading on a flight back to Cebu.</p><p><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/4291520/journal-images/philippines-9.jpg" alt="Clowning around with Cathy and company."></p><p><strong>Friday</strong>—Ran some errands in the morning with Dad. I played volleyball again in the afternoon. I then treated to dinner the people who took care of me during Sinulog—Derek, Lance, Honey, Xyza, Asha, Angel, Nel, Bless, and Linda.</p><p><strong>Saturday</strong>—Island hopping with Dad, some of his friends, and some company people. The day was spent riding on a jeepney to and from the harbor, boating from island to island (three total, I think), swimming with fish, and braving the cold weather. We ate lunch on the boat, too: rice, lumpia, marinated pork belly, kinilaw, shrimp, yams, and dried calamari.</p><p><strong>Sunday</strong>—Lunch at a dim sum restaurant. Afterwards, a long nap—my body was telling me I needed to rest.</p><p><strong>Monday</strong>—Travel.</p></section><footer class="post-footer container container--narrow"><ul class="post-tag-list"><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/daily/">daily</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/food/">food</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/philippines/">philippines</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/vacation/">vacation</a></li></ul></footer></article><script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.0.3/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/js/all.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">!function(e,a,t,n,c,o,s){e.GoogleAnalyticsObject=c,e[c]=e[c]||function(){(e[c].q=e[c].q||[]).push(arguments)},e[c].l=1*new Date,o=a.createElement(t),s=a.getElementsByTagName(t)[0],o.async=1,o.src=n,s.parentNode.insertBefore(o,s)}(window,document,"script","//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js","ga"),ga("create","UA-15132368-5","auto"),ga("send","pageview");</script></body></html>
