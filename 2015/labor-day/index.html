The project I’d been working for the last month and a half shipped on Tuesday, so I was focused on getting everything done in time. I put in extra hours in the mornings and evenings working from home, and a good chunk of the long weekend was spent in front of my laptop. I didn’t mind at all, though, since it’s work I like to do. It was exhilarating. I hadn’t felt that way since back in school.</p><p>I’m proud of the end result. We all became experts in a framework and language that were completely new to us at the start. I learned a lot of lessons on this project, too—don’t take shortcuts (they always catch up to you), don’t settle for a hack, and be patient and deliberate.</p><p>On top of this, I moved apartments in the middle of the week. What little time I had not working was spent getting set up and settled into my new place. Funny story, actually:</p><p>I met my new roommates Monday night to get the keys, and my new roommate Justin helped me move the couch from my old apartment. Afterwards, I went for a walk around the complex and ended up helping two other people move in in separate instances (I was already sweaty, so it was fine). The first person I helped because the mover offered me 20 bucks help him carry large furniture. I was about to head home after that when I passed by a girl with a bunch of luggage who looked lost, so I offered to help. When she was able to track down her roommates, they came down and we all helped carry her stuff up to the apartment.</p><p>I didn’t have time to get groceries and cook, so I ate out for lunch during the latter half of the week after I moved. I had cold-skin noodles, bánh mì ga, and a Cambodian coconut shrimp sandwich.</p><p>I played basketball in Brooklyn again on Saturday—it’s something I look forward to every week. Later that night, the girl who I helped move earlier in the week and her roommates invited me over for dinner. I stopped by again on Sunday and Monday (Labor Day) to help them build IKEA furniture, and they treated me to dinner on Monday night.</p><p>Sunday, I finally saw Michael again, for Tibetan noodles in Jackson Heights, Queens. Monday morning, I walked to Chinatown for groceries and cooked a pot of lu rou for lunch.</p></section><footer class="post-footer container container--narrow"><ul class="post-tag-list"><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/daily/">daily</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/food/">food</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/labor-day/">labor day</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/new-york/">new york</a></li></ul></footer></article><script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.0.3/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/js/all.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">!function(e,a,t,n,c,o,s){e.GoogleAnalyticsObject=c,e[c]=e[c]||function(){(e[c].q=e[c].q||[]).push(arguments)},e[c].l=1*new Date,o=a.createElement(t),s=a.getElementsByTagName(t)[0],o.async=1,o.src=n,s.parentNode.insertBefore(o,s)}(window,document,"script","//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js","ga"),ga("create","UA-15132368-5","auto"),ga("send","pageview");</script></body></html>
