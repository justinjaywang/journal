I met Dad in Berkeley first, then we stopped for some Vietnamese bún before BARTing to the city to find him a suit for the wedding.</p><p>The next morning, we walked over to Hotel Durant. When Jen and Brendan arrived, I helped unload stuff and then made a Costco run with Brendan, his dad, and Mike. For lunch, I had dry-fried green beans over rice at the Asian Ghetto. In the evening, we had rehearsal at the stadium and then dinner with family and friends at Angeline’s.</p><p>Saturday was filled with helping for the wedding, pictures for the wedding, the wedding itself, and more helping for the wedding. I ate leftover jambalaya from Angeline’s in the morning, then leftover baby back ribs for lunch. The venue was beautiful, the ceremony and reception went smoothly, and everyone seemed to have a good time.</p><p>I saw Jason early the next morning; we drove to a diner on 4th Street for breakfast and then chatted for a bit afterwards. Back at the hotel, I helped load up the remaining items as people checked out and went their separate ways. After lunch at Long Life Vegi house in downtown Berkeley with Mom and Dad, I traveled with Mom down to Jen’s place in San Jose. We ate at a Taiwanese restaurant for dinner, then dropped Mom off at the airport. I stayed over at Jen and Brendan’s that night. We hung out, just like old times, and I met the newest member of the family, their dog Zucchi.</p><p>The next day, the three of us drove to Berkeley to meet Dad for lunch at Turkish Kitchen. I walked with Dad around campus in the afternoon; in the evening, I had bún again with Dad and then headed to the airport.</p></section><footer class="post-footer container container--narrow"><ul class="post-tag-list"><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/berkeley/">berkeley</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/family/">family</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/food/">food</a></li><li class="post-tag-list-item"><a class="post-tag-list-link" href="/tag/vacation/">vacation</a></li></ul></footer></article><script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.0.3/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/js/all.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">!function(e,a,t,n,c,o,s){e.GoogleAnalyticsObject=c,e[c]=e[c]||function(){(e[c].q=e[c].q||[]).push(arguments)},e[c].l=1*new Date,o=a.createElement(t),s=a.getElementsByTagName(t)[0],o.async=1,o.src=n,s.parentNode.insertBefore(o,s)}(window,document,"script","//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js","ga"),ga("create","UA-15132368-5","auto"),ga("send","pageview");</script></body></html>
